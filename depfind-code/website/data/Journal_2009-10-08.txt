Fixed the WebWork-based web app, somewhat.  It turns out that if I want to use
Spring IoC, I need to add a few JAR files to the application and an empty
Spring config.  But maybe I just don't need Spring IoC.

Now, the web app starts, but nothing happens when I try to run =extract.action=.
I know the right method gets called because =start= and =stop= get assigned, but
=ExtractAction= does not look at the resources listed in =source=.

I tried to update the SVN repo first, in the hopes of copying the change to Git
afterwards.  This is probably a bad idea if I don't have access to the original
Git client where I first fetched the SVN repo.
