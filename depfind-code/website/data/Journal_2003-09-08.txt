Came up with an idea for a =LoadListenerBase= that would
handle the group-related events and maintain a stack of group data.
This way, all =VerboseListener= classes can share that
behavior, including rendering the group stack consistently.  This new
abstract base class would include much of the =LoadListener=
logic from =extract.jsp=.  I still not sure if I should call
it =LoadListenerBase= or =LoadAdapter=.
