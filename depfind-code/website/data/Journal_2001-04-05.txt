When attempting to locate a feature, the code now looks at
implemented interfaces too.  =ClassDifferences= will
use this for all fields and only for methods between classes or
between interfaces.

    * A field removed from an interface or from a class will only be showed as removed if it cannot be obtained from a superclass or supported interface.
    * A method removed from an interface will only be showed as removed if it cannot be obtained from a supported interface (superinterface).
    * A constructor or method removed from a class will only be showed as removed if it cannot be obtained from a superclass. It will not consider a matching method that would be obtained from an interfaces, since this interface would not provide an implementation for that method.

I renamed the packages.  I'm still not happy with all the names,
specially the =jt.tools= package.
