Pushed the =grails= branch back to the Git origin repository on SourceForge.  I
had to dig out the commands, since it had been a while.  Roughly, it looked like
this:

    1 =git checkout -b grails=
    1 ... a bunch of commits ...
    1 =git push origin grails=
    1 =git checkout master=
    1 =git branch -D grails=
    1 =git branch grails origin/grails=
    1 =git checkout grails=

I created the branch locally at first and made some commits to it.  I then
pushed it to the remote repository.  I wanted to change my setup so my local
branch would track against the remote branch, so I had to delete the local
branch before I could create the mapping I wanted.  I have to admit I found this
part was a little scary.  But it worked just fine.
