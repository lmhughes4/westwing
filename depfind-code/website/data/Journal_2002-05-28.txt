I was looking into Ant and found some interesting
features.  I added descriptions to the build script to help
people understand the various targets.  I also managed to
use the &lt;ant&gt; task to compile the =JarJarDiff=
test samples.

I realized that the combination of a validating parser
with remove DTDs might not work when disconnected from
the Web.  So I made the validating behavior optional in
=com.jeantessier.dependency.NodeLoader= and in
the =DependencyReporter= CLI application.

I upgraded all the scripts to use the new Xerces JAR
files configuration.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.4.1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.5Beta1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Log4J</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.2rc1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2.3</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jakarta ORO</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.0.5</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.0.6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
