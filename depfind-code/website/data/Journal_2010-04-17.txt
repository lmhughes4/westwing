My license for IntelliJ IDEA is about to expire.  I haven't been able to work
on Dependency Finder since I started working at
[[http://shopwell.com][ShopWell]], so I don't know if they'll consider the
project active enough to deserve a free license still.  But JetBrains has a
_community edition_ that is free and does everything I need, so it is not a
complete loss.  I installed it tonight to try it out.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>9.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>9.0.1 CE</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
