Minor clean up: removing trailing spaces.

There was a feature added to =JProgressBar= in JDK 1.4 where you could put it in
an _indeterminate_ state when you didn't know how long a task would be.  Back in
January 2003, I commented out the calls to =JProgressBar.setIndeterminate()= in
=OpenFileAction= and =MetricsExtractAction=.  I think it is safe to uncomment
them now.
