Refactored =JarJarDiff= and the XSL stylesheets
to generate both reports from the same XML file.  =JarJarDiff=
still supports the =-external= switch, but not for
long.  I am also more strict regarding what goes in the external
(i.e., public) report.  Now, all I need to do is be still more
strict on what features are reported, and restrict the report to
a subset of packages.

It turns out we want feature signatures after all.
