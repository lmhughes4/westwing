Making the switch to Java 5.0.
*If you're still running it with the JDK 1.4, let me know ASAP.*

Trying to compile for Java 1.4 with the 1.5 compiler is just too
risky.  It catches uses of the new language constructs, but not uses of
new API elements.  Relying on the compiler to keep me straight is just
not reliable.  And I'm tired of keeping multiple versions of the JDK
just so I can compile Dependency Finder in near-obsolete
technology.

Removed JARs for Xalan.  I'll rely on the version what ships with
the JDK.  It means that dependencies shift from =org.apache=
packages to =com.sun.org.apache= packages, which seems a
little fishy, especially since some of those have _internal_
in their name.  I'll have to read some more documentation about how
we're supposed to use those XSL-related classes.  On the plus side, I
can now use the default =XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader()=
method instead of hard-coding the Apache implementation.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Xalan</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.6.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>_none_</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
