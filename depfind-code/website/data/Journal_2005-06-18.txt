Took one more look at using JDK 1.5 to generate the code for JDK 1.3
instead of JDK 1.3 itself.  The differences are very minor, from what I
could see.  Mostly, it has to do with how JDK 1.3 was resolving method
calls to their latest definition, while from JDK 1.4 forward they are
resolved to the most specific class of the reference.  This has no ill
effect on running the code in the JDK 1.3 virtual machine.
