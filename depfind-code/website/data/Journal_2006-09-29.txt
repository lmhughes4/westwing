Changed classes in the =com.jeantessier.dependency.Printer= hierarchy to use
separate methods for printing scoped node names from dependency node names.
This lets me put scoped nodes in bold in the HTML output and leave dependency
names in regular font.  I should probably use CSS instead of hard-coding the
bold using =&lt;b&gt;= tags, though.

Fixed CLASSPATH in the launch scripts for JUnit to include all the libraries
needed by HttpUnit.  For the Windows batch file, I had to list all JARs
explicitly because I don't have a good way to detecting =*.jar= like I have in
Bash shell scripts.

There is a weird interaction between the JARs that breaks Commons-Logging when
using the Swing UI of JUnit.  If I don't use the automatic class reload
feature, it works just fine.  I tried playing with
=tests/junit/runner/excluded.properties= so JUnit would not reload the obvious
candidates (Commons-Logging, Jasper, even ServletUnit), but to no avail.
