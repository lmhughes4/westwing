I have been looking at the =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=
stylesheet, looking for a way to get the additional validation
now that the resolution has gone down to the feature level.
I have noticed that the =match= expression for
=class= nodes has exceeded some internal buffer in
Xalan.  If a add a few characters, I get an
=ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException= from the transformation
engine.
