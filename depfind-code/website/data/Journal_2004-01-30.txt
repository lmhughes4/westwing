Turns out the discussion on
[[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/][praprog]] was aimed
at code analyzers that are part of the language compilers and how they
traverse parse trees to determine the type of expressions in loosely
typed languages.  It was not directly related to the work done by
Dependency Finder, but there were still some interesting ideas.  Like
Tarjan's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees using depth-first
search.  It was a good exercise, even if the knowledge will not be
immediately useful.
