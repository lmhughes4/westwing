Upgraded Ant (1.0.8 -> 1.3) and Jakarta ORO (1.2 -> 1.2.1).

I need to get JUnit involved!

I thought of adding support in the =jt.classreader=
package for generating the =.class= file.  This way,
I can easily test the whole package by parsing and then rewriting
a =.class= file.  If the bytes are the same, then no
information was lost during parsing.
