I just started on the metrics features.  After these are
done, and I've completed the user's manual, I'll be done
with this release!

I need to adjust the =MetricsFactory= to create
the elementary measurements at each level and then setup the
composite measurements from some configuration.  This will set
the stage for using custom configuration files for custom
metrics reports in the next release.
