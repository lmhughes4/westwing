Looked into making each implementation of
=Measurement= compute its own metrics,
instead of having everything crammed in
=MetricsGatherer=.  This is a major
undertaking and will have to wait until after I have
launched the first beta test.  I would have to create
over 60 custom =Measurement= implementations,
one for each current measurement collected by the
gatherer.
