Found and fixed bug #667642 about =MetricsFactory= not
recognizing static initializers of the form "=static {}=".

Switched =log4j.properties= to use CHAINSAW instead
of log files.

Found another article on [[http://thesmallworlds.com/][Small Worlds]].
This time, it was a review in Software Development Magazine.

The more I think of it, the more I was to revamp
=-verbose= and get rid of =-trace=
switches.  I'll have =-verbose= behave somewhat like
=extract.jsp= or the status bar of the GUI tools.
