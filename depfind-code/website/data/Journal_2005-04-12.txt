Someone is having problems computing closures and finding paths
between components.  Can't blame them, the output from
=DependencyClosure= is very hard to follow.

They claim that in JDK 1.3.1, there is a path from
=JTree= to =Toolkit= through
=MouseEvent=.  =DependencyClosure= found one
through =Component= and I looked at the source for
=MouseEvent= from 1.3.1_09 and there is no mention of
=Toolkit= in there.  There is in JDK 1.4 but not in
1.3.

At the time, I didn't have =rt.jar= handy to repeat the
tests, so I used =DependencyFinder.jar= instead.  At first,
I tried to find a closure from
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.cli.DependencyExtractor=
to =com.jeantessier.commandline.MultipleValuesSwitch=.  I
thought it called =CommandLine.addMultipleValuesSwitch()=
and would then find =MultipleValuesSwitch= from there, but
it doesn't.  Of course, =DependencyExtractor= does not have
multiple value switches, so there is no feature-to-feature path from
it to =MultipleValuesSwitch=.  I will need to document this
situation, in case someone else comes upon it too.

Gave some more thought to a specialized printer for transitive
closures.

Finishing the documentation shouldn't take too long.  Definitely not
long enough to justify having a beta release while we're waiting.
