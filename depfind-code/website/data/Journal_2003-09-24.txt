Found some interesting leads for free graphical packages in next
month's JavaPro magazine.  I will need to look more closely into JChart
and JOpenChart.  There also seems to be a few packages out there for
dealing with PDF files.  That could also be an interesting avenue for
future development.

That same issue of JavaPro also listed
[[http://thesmallworlds.com/][Small Worlds]] as an analysis
tool.  I will need to write to them that maybe they should have listed
Dependency Finder too.  :-)

Moved the CLI's and Ant's =VerboseListener= classes to
use the new =VerboseListenerBase=.  I aligned their output
to match more closely that of =extract.jsp=.

Interestingly, I had CLI's =VerboseListener= extend from
=java.io.PrintWriter= for some reason.  Of course, it made
changing in to extend from =VerboseListenerBase= instead a
rather interesting experience.  Let this be a lesson against inheriting
implementation.  Incidentally, the other candidates for extending
=VerboseListenerBase= are in the GUI and already extend
=javax.swing.AbstractAction=.  I am not sure how I'm going
to deal with this one, yet.
