Worked on tools documentation.

Found a bug with =GraphSummarizer=.  I describe it
fully on SourceForge; it is bug 
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D649375&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][#649375]].
Basically, when adding dependency between nodes from two different
node factories, such as in =GraphSummarizer=, the logic
that prevents self-dependencies relied on all classes of a package
being present, which may not be the case while summarizing a graph.
I rewrote the validation logic in =Node= and its subclasses
to use a template method instead.  Since it does not rely on list
traversal anymore, it should speed things up a bit (but I have not
tried to measure it).

Relabeled the beta from "0.1 beta" to "1.0 beta 1".  It might
have a little more appeal, so more people will try the software.
