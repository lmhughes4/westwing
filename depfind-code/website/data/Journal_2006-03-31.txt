SourceForge's CVS repository was down yesterday and today.

I signed up for a migration to Subversion.  I have been heading some good about
it and it looks like the switch is easy.  Even though SourecForge's CVS is
down, they were able to migrate my project and I could browse it using ViewVC.
But when I tried to check it out, it failed.  IntelliJ did not report any
error, but didn't create the project either and the checkout only had =website=
and was missing =DependencyFinder=.  I tried with SmartSVN, but didn't get any
further, except that it complained about a bad socket read at some point.
Maybe if I have them migrate it again, after CVS is operational again, it will
work better.  Subversion would be nice: it has atomic checkins and it knows
about folders, so you can move or rename parts of the filesystem and retain the
history.

Started working on Fit tests for metrics for identifier length.  I want to
compute the length of package names, class names, and method names, both in
number of characters and number of words.
