Refactored the way =APIDifferenceStrategy= collects field names and method
signatures.  I extracted a method that takes a function object, a poor cousin
to blocks in Ruby.  At first, I used an inner interface inside
=APIDifferenceStrategy= and anonymous inner classes at the call sites.  But
then I thought I might reuse it elsewhere, so I pulled everything out as
stand-alone classes in =com.jeantessier.classreader=: interface =FeatureMapper=
and implementations =NameMapper= and =SignatureMapper=.  Don't confuse them
with =PackageMapper= which is completely different.
