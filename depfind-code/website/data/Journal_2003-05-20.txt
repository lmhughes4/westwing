Worked on the design for the new closure calculator.  It will be a
little more structured and keep track of each layer as the closure is
expanded.  This way, I should be able to print actual paths instead of
just dumping the graph and let users figure it out.  I will also be
able to use this calculator in finding the shortest path between two
groups of elements (packages, classes, and/or features).

I haven't heard anything about the ongoing beta trial, except for
the nasty problem with the ZIP file.  I'm thinking of closing the beta
and release 1.0 over the upcoming Memorial Day weekend (this weekend).
I'll see.
