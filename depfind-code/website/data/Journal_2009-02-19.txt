I am toying with the idea of using [[http://jetty.mortbay.org/jetty/][Jetty]].
With it, I could embed a webserver in the application instead of using Swing.
This way, I can provide the user experience entirely from the web application
instead of maintaining a separate Swing version.

Documentation on configuring Jetty with an existing web application is sketchy
at best.  I was hoping for a simple, fool-proof recipe, but it looks like I
might have to do actual work to get this to work.

Reading a little more about this, it looks like Jetty already ships as part of
[[http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/][WebWork]].  WebWork's
[[http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/wikidocs/QuickStart.html][QuickStart]]
uses Jetty to provide a quick starting point for development.  This QuickStart
may not be the best approach for deploying an application, though.
