Found a bug in the Unix script for =OOMetricsGUI=.  It
tried to be clever and use a local variable based on the named under
which the script was invoked to determine the class name to start.  It
works for all other scripts, but in this case, the class name is
different from the script name.  The script =OOMetrics=
starts =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.*cli*.OOMetrics=
and the script =OOMetricsGUI= starts
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.*gui*.OOMetrics=.

I fixed the bug and issued patch
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1100722&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435886][#1100722]].

Fixed the bug using a CVS branch: =bug-1100131=.
