Fixed =DependencyMetrics= in both the CLI and Ant task.
It used to process each graph input file as it was loaded, which could
result in some nodes being counted more than once if they show up in
more than one file.  By reading all graphs beforehand, they get merged
together before the measurements are taken, preventing double
count.
