Wrote =FitTestSuite= and =FitTest= to run Fit
tests with JUnit.  I got it to automatically pickup HTML files in a
given folder and to have tests fail when there are failures in one of
the tables in an HTML document.  Now, I can subclass
=FitTestSuite= and give it a folder name in
=suite()= to have it process a given folder.

Fit automatically compacts phrases like _is confirmed_ into
camel-case identifiers like =isConfirmed=.  It works on my
desktop but not on my laptop.  The Fit version is the same, pretty much
everything is the same.  Maybe the JVM patch version is different, but
that's it.  I am baffled.
