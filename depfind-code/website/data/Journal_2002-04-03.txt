First shot at tracking documentation levels using
=JarJarDiff=.

After looking at the format used by Argo/UML to save UML project
files, I'm having renewed interest in XMI to import dependency
graph into UML modeling tools.  This would allow people to draw
the graph visually using their favorite UML tool.  Argo/UML also
uses PGML to store graphics.  This has led to W3C to standardize
SVG, which I might be looking into in the future.
