Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>4.7</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>4.8.2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I also ran =JarJarDiff= on various versions of JUnit from 3.8.2 to 4.8.2.  I
added the results to the Samples page for JUnit.
