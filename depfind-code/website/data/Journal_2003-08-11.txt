Figured a way to get at the information in the JAR file's
=/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF= entry.  I now use it in the web
application's JSPs to generate the "Powered by ..." branding with a URL
back to the Dependency Finder website.  I will soon refactor it into a
class I can use with =-version= switches in the CLI and in
an About box in the GUI.

I tried to use
=getClass().getResourceAsStream("/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")=,
but the classloader has to defer to its parent first, before it tries
to resolve anything.  So I always go the manifest for the JDK itself.
I had to get the resource URL for the class itself first, and parse it
to extract the path to the JAR file instead, and extract its manifest
via the =java.util.jar= package.
