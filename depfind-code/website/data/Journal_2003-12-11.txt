Someone has been trying to analyze a large codebase with limited
memory.  They're interested in counting class-level dependencies and
have been using =DependencyReporter= to reduce the graph and
then count inbound and outbound dependencies.  I suggested they use
=OOMetrics= instead.  It has a whole group of oddly named
measurements (OEP, IIPM, etc.) that already track dependencies.  As I
was reviewing them especially in the context of
=MartinConfig.xml=, I realized they were kind of cryptic and
I need to document what each one does and how you can combine them to
arrive at the counts you're interested in.

I noticed that measurement IEPM and OEPF had the wrong long name.
They said "Extra-Class" when they are actually "Extra-Package".
