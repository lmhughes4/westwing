Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.5.3-1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.6.0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Jakarta ORO</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.0.7</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.0.8</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

There is a nice new feature in Javadoc that Ant 1.6 now makes
available to me.  The =-linksource= switch to Javadoc links
the documentation to the source code.  An HTML-ized version of the
source files is created alongside the javadocs.  I also saw something
called either "j2h"  or "java2html" a while back that created
hyperlinked version of the source code, complete with syntax
highlighting.  I wonder if I could somehow get to two to work together.
The links between documentation and source could definitely be useful,
and the syntax highlighting is quite cool too.

I hesitated to checking the new version of =build.xml=
that uses the =linksource= attribute to the
=&lt;java&gt;= task.  This would require that people upgrade
to Ant 1.6 just to compile Dependency Finder.  But then again, it is
only if they try to generate the javadocs, so it shouldn't really be a
problem.
