Added a feature to =ClassMetrics= that counts the occurrence of each VM
instruction in the analyzed codebase.  I had to do some minor refactoring of
classes =Hex= and =Instruction=.  The feature is actually in the class
=com.jeantessier.classreader.MetricsGatherer= and used by the UI classes for
the CLI and the matching Ant task.
