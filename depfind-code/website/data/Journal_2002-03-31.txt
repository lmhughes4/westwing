I finished the reorganization of the =Differences=
hierarchy for the Decorator pattern.  I have made this change to
ease listing of documentation status changes.  Come to think of
it, I might not have needed this change to do the new feature.

I have added some documentation for =JarJarDiff=
in preparation for the new feature..
