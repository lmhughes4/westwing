Found a misnamed method.  =VisitorBase.visitClassfile_Annotations_()= should
have been called =VisitorBase.visitClassfile_Attributes_()=.

Worked on =Method_info.getSignature()= to use the generic signature of a
=Signature_attribute= when it is available.  In the process, I realized that I
never finished =SignatureHelper=.
