Fixed =DependencyFinder= to use the new
=Monitor= when re-extracting =.class= file.  In
the process, I fixed it so it retains all extracted locations instead
of just the last one, like it used to do.  I had to make changes to
many of the action classes, but overall the structure has improved a
little.  It still needs more testing.

Adjusted =load.jsp= to remove the monitor and dispatcher
when loading the graph from XML files.
