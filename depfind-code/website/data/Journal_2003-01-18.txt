Looked at ways to restrict listed metrics to the classes and
methods actually visited, instead of all referenced elements.  I
tried to distinguish between getting a metrics and creating it
only as part of a =VisitX()= method, but that didn't
work since metrics would only start accumulating after their
call to =VisitX()=.  I'll have to try something else.
