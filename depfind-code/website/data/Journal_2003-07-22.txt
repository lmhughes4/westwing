Someone found a bug with =DependencyReporter=.  It does
not close its =PrintWriter= and ends up truncating the
output.  I created a patch for it, after verifying that it was the only
tool experiencing this problem.

I also created a patch for the "refresh" button (a.k.a. "reload") on
=DependencyFinder=.

I also created a patch for the clean up of calls to
=flush()= from a while ago.

I cleaned up some indentation text.  There were still places where
there were four spaces instead of =TAB= characters.

About the whole optionally using a =GraphCopier= thing,
I have been thinking that this functionality really belongs to the
advanced controls and I don't need to clutter the simple controls with
it.

Upgraded my testing environment from Clover 1.1.1 to 1.2.
