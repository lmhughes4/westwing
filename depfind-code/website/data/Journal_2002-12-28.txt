Fixed all the broken unit tests for metrics.

Added metrics-processing events so the UI can track
progress in =OOMetricsGUI=.

For a while, Jakarta ORO had two versions of
=Perl5Util.split()= that differed in how they
split the empty string "".  They seem to have fixed the
discrepancy in their latest version, so I moved my code
to the new version that uses =java.util.Collection=
instead of =java.util.Vector=, which is
deprecated.
