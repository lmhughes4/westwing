Fixed progress bar notification in GUI.  It had trouble dealing with
the processing of nested groups and was getting off track.  In doing
so, I ended up renaming events under =DependencyListener=
and =MetricsListener= from =StartX()= and
=StopX()= to =BeginX()= and = EndX()=
respectively.  This way, all events follow the same convention.  It
could impact people who developed on top of Dependency Finder, I'll
see if it causes an uproar.  They should be able to upgrade by simply
renaming their methods and adding empty implementations for the new
=BeginSession()= and =EndSession()= events.
