Augmented =CycleDetector= to detect cycles at the class level.

Added Fit tests for cycles at the class or feature levels.  Next, I will need
to look for cycles that span levels, like in the Visitor pattern.

[[../images/VisitorPattern.gif]]

    BaseClass
        accept(Visitor)
            --&gt; Visitor
    ClassA
        --&gt; BaseClass
        accept(Visitor)
            --&gt; Visitor
            --&gt; Visitor.visitClassA(ClassA)
    ClassB
        --&gt; BaseClass
        accept(Visitor)
            --&gt; Visitor
            --&gt; Visitor.visitClassB(ClassB)
    Visitor
        visitClassA(ClassA)
            --&gt; ClassA
        visitClassB(ClassB)
            --&gt; ClassB

These cycles go from some feature to a class and continues through the features
of that class.  For this to work, =CycleDetector= would have to look at lower
levels when seeking cycles from a node.  It would have to drill down from
=PackageNode= to =ClassNode= and from =ClassNode= to =FeatureNode= as
appropriate.

I also fixed the image links in the Journal.  Since I switched to a CGI script,
the URL is no longer a prefix of the =images/= folder where the images are.
Links to images must now be prefixed with =../=.
