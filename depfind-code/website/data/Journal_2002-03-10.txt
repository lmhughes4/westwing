I wrote =ListBasedValidator= and I have
=ListVisibleElements=, a doclet for listing programming
elements that have been flagged through their javadoc comments.
This way, one can use javadoc tags to flag classes and features
as part of the published API and guide =DiffToExternalHTML=
to limit the report to those classes and features.

I've started to adjust =DiffToExternalHTML=, but
that XSL non-trivial.
