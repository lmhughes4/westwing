Fixed the documentation for =OOMetrics= to remove references to the old =-all=
switch in the CLI.

Changed the path in the distribution archives so Dependency Finder extracts to
a folder that include the release label in its name.  Distributions used to all
extract themselves to =DependencyFinder= and would overwrite each other.  Now,
they extract to =DependencyFinder-_&lt;version&gt;_= instead, like
=DependencyFinder-1.2.1= for instance.  The previous naming scheme worked well
when I was developing on a Windows platform and changing the =PATH= was
tedious.  But now that I work mostly on Mac and Unix, I can use a simple
symbolic link.

I also modified the installation instructions to include the current version
number directly in the text.  I was already injecting it to label the
instructions at the top of the document.  It was easy enough to replace the
reference throughout the document.
