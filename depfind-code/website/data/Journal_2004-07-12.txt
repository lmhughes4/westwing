Someone pointed out that the HTML in the website have a
=DOCTYPE= for HTML 4.01 but actually contain XHTML
markup.  Things like =&lt;br /&gt;= and
=&lt;a name="..." /&gt;=.  This last one is specially
troublesome since most browsers start looking for the closing
=&lt;/a&gt;= tag and consider everything past the opening
tag a hyperlink.  I should change them to
=&lt;a name="..." &gt;&lt;/a&gt;= instead.  I'll try to fix
them shortly.
