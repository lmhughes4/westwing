I'm back.

Suppose you place a query against a dependency graph.  You only want
to see class-to-class dependencies.  If a method is class A calls a
method in class B, but class A does not refer to class B directly,
there is an implicit dependency =A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B= but
not an explicit dependency =A&nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp;B=.  99% of
the time, you want to see the implicit dependency.  But on rare
occasions, you don't.  Is that justification enough to add a switch to
the user experience to show only explicit dependencies?  The code is
already written; it means using a =GraphCopier= instead of
a =GraphSummarizer= to perform the query.  This is what the
tools do when the graph is maximized anyway.  I think I'll sit on this
one a little while longer.  I can always use
=DependencyExtractor= and look at the raw output for the
rare times I don't want to see implicit dependencies.
