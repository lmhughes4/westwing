Found a reference to Dependency Finder on the
[[http://osswin.sourceforge.net/][OSSwin]] project page.  They
had mistakenly listed the licensing scheme as GPL when it is actually
BSD, but it has all been fixed now.  This project is a nice,
comprehensive list of open source software for the Windows platform.

I also found someone who listed Dependency Finder in their resume
under a "tools used" heading.  I will take it as a testimony to the
broad acceptance and wide adoption of Dependency Finder.  :-)

Someone asked if I could add the line number where the dependencies occur in
the dependency graph.  Back on [[2002-10-31]], I had toyed with the idea of
modeling each dependency with their own object.  This would allow me to collect
a lot more data about each dependency, but at the cost of massive object
creation.  I'm afraid this would impact performance too much.  I'll keep
thinking about it some more.
