For some obscure reason, my laptop won't let me start SmartCVS
anymore.  It complains that I don't have Java 1.4 or later installed.
I have JDK 1.5!  I tried everything, up to and including uninstalling
both SmartCVS and JDK and reinstalling them, to no avail.  I figured
I'd use the CVS support in IntelliJ IDEA, but the branch only exists
on the source code and not on the website module, which confused my IDE
for a little while.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>SmartCVS</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>4.0.5</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>4.0.6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
