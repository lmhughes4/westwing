Did some screen capture for the tutorial.  My previous version had
crappy mockups in PowerPoint.  I captured the same pictures in both the
web application and the GUI, but the images are too big (800x600) to
put in the PowerPoint slides that make up the tutorial.  If I shrink
them down to make them fit, I cannot make out the details that I need
to show.  So I will need to crop the important parts out, on all
images.
