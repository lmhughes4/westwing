I found two other tools that do similar things as
Dependency Finder: [[http://remotejava.com/classdep/][classdep]]
and [[http://www.headwaysoftware.com/][reView]].

Faced with the declining number of downloads of Dependency
Finder recently, I'm going to have to start advertising.  I'm going to
start by spamming newsgroups...  See you in comp.lang.java.*  :-)
