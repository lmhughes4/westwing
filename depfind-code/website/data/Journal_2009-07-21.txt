Fixed =CodeDependencyCollector= to correctly track dependencies on classes and
enum values referenced in annotation values.

Found a bug: when =CodeDependencyCollector= visits the attributes of a class, it
attaches dependencies to the last method it visited instead of to the class
itself.  Luckily, there is a handy hook called
=VisitorBase.visitClassAnnotations()= that lets me intercept control and restore
the current node right after visiting fields and methods and before visiting the
annotations.
