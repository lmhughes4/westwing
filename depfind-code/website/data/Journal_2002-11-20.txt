Submitted a proposal for the _Spotlight on Open Source_
column in [[http://www.sys-con.com/java/][Java Developer Journal]].

Found an article on dependencies titled <i>Managing Java
Source Code Dependencies for SCM</i> in Java Developer Journal,
vol. 7, no. 11, November 2002.  It deals mainly with compile-time
dependencies and keeping track of components under revision
control, but still makes a few good points regarding dependencies
in general.

Fixed some minor bugs in how I generate the manual.
