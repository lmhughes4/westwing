A colleague pointed me to [[http://code.google.com/p/google-depan/][DepAn]],
another dependency analysis tool for Java.  It seems to be built on the Eclipse
platform and uses ASM for decompiling Java bytecode.  It is distributed as a
binary for the Linux platform.  It won't work on my Mac and I couldn't get it
to start on my Linux box either.

Looking into running DependencyFinder on
[[http://code.google.com/appengine/][Google App Engine]] or
[[http://amazon.com/ec2][Amazon EC2]].  Users would have to upload their JAR
files to the server, though.
