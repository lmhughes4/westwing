The "=No more DTM IDs=" problem with using Ant's
=&lt;xslt&gt;= task has surfaced again.  I had not given it
any thoughts since last April.  The solution is to upgrade Xalan in JDK
1.4.1 or use its =java.endorsed.dirs= settings.  I added
an additional documentation page under "tasks", but I will need to
explain it further and tests workarounds.

Added =dependencyfindertasks.properties= so defining Ant
tasks is made easier.
