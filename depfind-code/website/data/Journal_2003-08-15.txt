Added a =BeanInfo= helper class to the
=Version= class.  This way, I can use
=&lt;jsp:getProperty&gt;= tags in JSPs and not have to call
my accessors =getX()= and =setX()=.  It works on
Tomcat, but I remember having problems with using =BeanInfo=
with other application servers in the past.  I just hope they have made
progress since.

I found a bug (#789373) with using the XSL stylesheet
=PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl= from Ant with the
=&lt;xslt&gt;= task.  I will have to investigate, but I
should really rewrite that entire stylesheet so it complies with proper
XSL rules.  In the meantime, people can use the
=&lt;java&gt;= task to run Xalan's XSL processor,
=org.apache.xalan.xslt.Process=, instead.  Just make sure
you set =fork="yes"= on the task's attributes so that JDK
1.3 VMs pick up the Xalan JAR file.  The bug report has a sample Ant
build file that shows how to do it.  I will also add it to the
documentation eventually.

Ran =JarJarDiff= on Xerces and Xalan for the latest
upgrade.
