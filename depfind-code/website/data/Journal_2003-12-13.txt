Well, it didn't work out.  They tried to break down their codebase
but all their =DependencyReporter= output is either of
size zero or badly truncated.

Back in July, I had problems with truncated files, but back then it
was because =java.io.Writer= instances were not being closed.
I removed all calls to =java.io.Writer.flush()= because the
stream is supposed to be automatically flushed when it is closed.  It
has worked just well for me since then and I am troubled that they
should be having these kinds of problems.

They gave me a copy of their codebase to try and recreate the
problem, but it worked fine for me.  I'm down to thinking maybe it's
because they're on Linux, for some reason.  But that can't be it.

As I was working out their problem, I realized how great it is to
have =DependencyReporter= to merge graphs together.  I can
give it as many graphs as I want and it can combine them all
together.  I noticed the Ant task version doesn't do that; it can
only take a single graph at a time.  I'll need to fix that.

I fixed measurements IEPM's and OEPF's long name.  Now, I'll need
to create a patch for this.
