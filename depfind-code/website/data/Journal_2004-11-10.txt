Adjusted the UI for =closure.jsp= and
=advancedclosure.jsp= to use radio buttons when specifying
the degree of summarization to apply to the closure.

Adjusted =build.xml= to use Tomcat's manager when
deploying the web application.  At the same time, I extracted some of
the properties to external properties files, such as those dealing with
Tomcat or CVS tasks.

Added better examples to the documentation of the
=dependencyclosure= Ant task.
