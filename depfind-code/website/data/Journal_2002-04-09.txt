I am almost done with new features to =JarJarDiff=!

I fixed all the unit tests and the XSL stylesheets.  In the
process, I fixed a bug in =PackageDifferences= and
=ClassDifferences= when adding decorators.

=DiffToExternal= may need additional tweaking.  I
also need an new XSL stylesheet to extract the documentation
level information from all the other differences.
