Fixed =CollectionSelectionCriteria= so it has separate
include and exclude lists.  This way, I can leave the include list as
=null= to indicate a wildcard and explicitly exclude names
from a list.  The previous implementation applied the the excluded
list to a predefined inclusion list, preventing me from doing
"anything but ..." type of logic.

Next, I'll need to combine regular expression-based with list-based
selection criteria for maximum flexibility.  This will mean some kind
of _AndSelectionCriteria_.
