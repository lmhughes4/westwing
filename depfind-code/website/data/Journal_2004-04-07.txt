Someone else asked me about JAR-to-JAR dependencies.  Last time I pondered this
question was on [[2003-11-14]].

Since then, I thought of adding another layer at the top of the dependency
graph, above the package layer.  But passing the JAR information around all the
way to the dependency extractor would introduce changes in the data model that I
am not completely comfortable with.

Plus, this new layer would be incomplete.  What should I do with outbound
references to classes beyond the scope of the tool, that are possibly in other,
unknown JARs?  What should I do with packages that span multiple JARs?

Maybe with a parallel layer besides the packages instead of above it.  This
would impact visitors and printers and any other parts that deal with the
dependency graph.  And it still doesn't solve the problem of dependencies on
classes outside the ones being analyzed.

I'll need to give this some more thought, still.
