I've been reading "UML for Java Programmers" by Robert C. Martin.
In one chapter, he talks about dependency management and recommends
using tools to automatically track them in code.  He goes so far as to
recommend JDepend to readers.  I wonder if he'd recommend Dependency
Finder too.  Maybe if I add a package-level dependency cycle detection
feature, it would make the tool even more useful.  At some point, I
will have to start thinking about going beyond the raw data and have
the tools do more work when it comes to analyzing design quality
factors.
