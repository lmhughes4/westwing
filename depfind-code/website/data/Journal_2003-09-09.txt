Looked into using the JSP compiler from Tomcat to automatically
compile the web app's JSPs.  This way, I can include their dependencies
in reports and so forth.

At the same time, I noticed some nice patterns in how to use Ant
with external properties files.  I might even apply some of them to
Dependency Finder.
