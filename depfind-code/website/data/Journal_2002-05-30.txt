I'm working out =MetricsGatherer= to bring it
closer to the old, hard-coded =MetricsFactory=.
This is going to take a while ...

The optional validation was not enough when working in a
disconnected environment.  It still tried to load the DTD,
even though it was not using it to validate the document.
I've used an Apache feature to turn off loading of external
DTDs when validation is turned off.  It now works fine.
