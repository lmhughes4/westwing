False alarm.  They reinstalled the latest version of Dependency
Finder and it now works just fine.  I am extremely relieved to hear
this.  I was not looking forward to tracking weird flushing bugs.

Created a patch for fixing the long names for =IEPM=
and =OEPF= and published it as
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D860191&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435886][patch #860191]].

Fixed Ant tasks that are subclasses of =GraphTask= to
accept multiple graphs.  Like =&lt;javac&gt;= and others,
you can use either the =srcfile= attribute or a nested
=&lt;src&gt;= element, or you can even use both.  It uses a
path-like structure, but I wanted to use a =FileSet=
instead.  You cannot really provide a directory, you have to specify
XML files.  But as I was editing the documentation, I came upon tasks
that are subclasses of =FileSet= and can have nested
=&lt;include&gt;= elements.  I'll have to look into doing
something similar instead of what I did just now.

I wanted to look at the size of serialized graphs to compare full
graphs to class-to-class graphs.  The way references are handled in
serialized graphs is closer to how it's handled in memory than my own
XML format.  But I ran into a stack overflow situation when I tried
to serialize this one graph.  This whole idea of serializing graphs is
just getting worse and worse.
