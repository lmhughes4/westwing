Tried to get a simple example of
[[http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/][Guice]] working with
[[http://struts.apache.org/2.x/][Struts2]] in Tomcat, but no matter what I
tried, I couldn't get it to work. It's like it cannot find my bindings, for
some reason.  I would really love to use Guice and WebWork (now Struts2) in the
webapp.
