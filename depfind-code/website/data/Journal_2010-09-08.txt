Moved the Google Analytics tracking code from the old Urchin-based to their new
Asynchronous Snippet.  Quite frankly, nobody should notice the difference.

I had to cut and paste the snippet to many files.  That was annoying, so I
extracted it to a separate =.js= so I could copy a single line script inclusion
instead.  Then, I realized that defeated the purpose of Google's Asynchronous
Snippet, whose purpose is to not delay the loading of the page by including
other scripts synchronously.  So I'm back to cut and pasting "large" snippets.
