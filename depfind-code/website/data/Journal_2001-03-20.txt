=JarJarDiff= is done, along with its stylesheets.  If I
have the time, I'll build test cases so we can verify that it really
does trap everything it's supposed to.

The script =JarJarDiff.bat= takes two codebases (JAR files,
Zip files, or directories) and saves the differences in an XML document.

The script =DiffToInternalHTML.bat= takes the XML document
generated by =JarJarDiff= and transforms it completely to HTML.

The script =DiffToExternalHTML.bat= takes the XML document
generated by =JarJarDiff= and transforms the public subset of
it to HTML.

I may need to split this website according to the various tools:

    * =DependencyExtractor=
    * =DependencyReporter=
    * =DependencyClosure=
    * =DependencyMetrics=
    * =ClassMetrics=
    * =JarJarDiff=
    * utilities
 
I may also need to revise the package names and organization.
