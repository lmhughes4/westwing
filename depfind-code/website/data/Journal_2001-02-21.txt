Added the =ClassfileLoader= hierarchy in the
=jt.dependencyfinder.classreader=
package.  This allows me to read from =.class=
files from a directory tree, from a JAR file, or from a
Zip files.

Right now, the loaders load and parse everything in
the constructors.  I need to enhance these classes to
do lazy loading and provide a list of the entries they
contain.  Whether these entries will be file names or
class names is not decided yet.

I also need to enhance the classes in the
=jt.dependencyfinder.classreader=
package to provide better navigation and query mechanisms
in the =Classfile=-rooted structure.  I need to
be able to pull methods and fields by name rather than
iterate through the collections.  I need to simple query
methods when looking for tagging attributes such as
=Synthetic_attribute= or
=Deprecated_attribute=.
