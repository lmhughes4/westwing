Someone is having problems with =JarJarDiff= when their
JAR files are generated by Maven, an Apache tool that looks like a
super-Ant.  I'm going on vacation, I cannot look into it right now.
It will have to wait until I return.  The problem seems related to
the =MANIFEST.MF= file, so maybe if they rename the files
to =.zip= it will bypass that file and work.

Uploaded a patch to fix the extraneous text in the output of
=OOMetrics=.
