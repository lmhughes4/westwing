Modified journal entries to turn dates into hyperlinks.

Extracted the implicit index from instructions =_x_load%5F_&lt;i&gt;_= and
=_x_store%5F_&lt;i&gt;_= to be the value of =_&lt;i&gt;_=.  Those values point
to entries in the local variable array of the current frame.  I could use them
to provide better text rendering of instructions by naming the variable (when
there is a =LocalVariableTable= present in the =Code_attribute=).
