Moved the detailed dependency-related measurement explanations from
the Developer Guide to the Manual.  Finalized the documentation for
measurements, at least for now.

Renamed =SymbolList= to =ListSymbols=.
Finished its documentation and wrote a corresponding Ant task.

Started looking at
[[http://fitnesse.org/][FitNesse]] and the
[[http://fit.c2.com/][FIT framework]] again.
One thing I don't understand is how to set these up as part of an
automated build and put the contents under source control.  Someone on
the FitNesse Yahoo! group gets weird behavior when they put the
contents of the FitNesse wiki under CVS and the gurus don't seem to
have an easy solution.  One option is to use the FIT framework by
itself, but how do I run all the tests automatically and have them
report that everything went fine or not?
