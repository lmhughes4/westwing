I requested a SourceForge project and had it approved the
same day.  I got SSH to work, but CVS still eludes me.

I'm going to change the licensing.  I'm going to move away
from [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html][LGPL]]
to a [[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html][BSD-style]]
license.
