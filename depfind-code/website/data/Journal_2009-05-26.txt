Found out about [[http://crap4j.org][Crap4J]], but I'm having a hard time fine
tuning the sample =build.xml= file so I can run it on Dependency Finder.  I
should add it to the Resources page.

I want to redo =ClassList= to simply use a =LoadListener= to collect class names
as they are being read in.  Coupled with a lightweight =Classfile=, it would
reduce its memory footprint.  Right now, it uses an =AggregatingClassfileLoader=
and parses an entire JAR completely before simply writing out class names.  This
is a waste of time and memory and it hurts when dealing with really large JAR
files.
