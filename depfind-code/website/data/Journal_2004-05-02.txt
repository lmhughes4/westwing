Added scope lists for =OOMetrics= similar to its current
filter lists.  I don't know what good they could serve yet, since any
such filtering could already be achieved by extracting only the desired
classes.

Added =-show-all-metrics= switch to
=OOMetrics= to show metrics for classes that were not
extracted.  This is so I can list metrics regarding inbound
dependencies on classes outside the examined codebase, so I can group
dependencies on deprecated symbols by those same deprecated symbols.
It still uses =-filter-includes-list= to limit the tracking
to dependencies on deprecated symbols, but all non-deprecated classes
and methods will now be empty.  With the new switch, it will list all
non-empty metrics, including those metrics attached to symbols outside
the codebase.

CVS on SourceForge is down again.
