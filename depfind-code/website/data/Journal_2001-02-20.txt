Added a SAX parser for reading the dependency
[[Components.html#xml][XML format]], using Xerces
from Apache.

Added an embryonic =DependencyReporter= tool.
I'm thinking of having this tools output some form of XML
and then use XSLT to convert it to whatever I need.  I
would most likely use Apache's Xalan for that.

I'm also thinking of another tool that would create
a file hierarchy that mirrors the one from =javadoc=.
This way, I could embed dependency information in the
automatically generated documentation.  Each class comments
could include a hyperlink to a local file with the dependencies
for that class.  The same would go for packages.

I also need to figure a way to read =.class=
from JAR files, in addition to directories.
