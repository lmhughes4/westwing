Finished installing =Monitor= in the GUI.  The
=Monitor= now has a notion of open vs. closed sessions.
An open session keeps accumulating data across load sessions.  It never
tries to remove files that were "not visited".  A closed session works
like the previous version of =Monitor= and follows closely
the load sessions, removing classes from files that were not visited in
the latest session.
