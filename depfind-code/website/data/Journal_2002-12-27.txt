Finally got to fixing the broken unit tests, for metrics,
at least.

It turns out that JDK 1.4 is doing some funny accounting
for line numbers in try ... catch blocks and this fixes some
inaccuracies in my SLOC estimation.  These changes in the
generated bytecode will help debuggers step through these
clauses with more meaningful feedback.  By removing the
special accounting in =MetricsGatherer=, the SLOC
count of code compiled with previous versions of the JDK
will be slightly underestimated.  But it is a rough estimate
to begin with, so I guess it is safe.

I am going to standardize the tests for JDK 1.4 and the
way that it generates bytecode.  In the future, I might put
special instrumentation in the tests to detect bytecode that
has been compiled with previous versions of the JDK, but it
is not a priority for now.
