Added filtering to =NbSubMetricsMeasurement=.  I
was misled into thinking I could simply count classes that have
outbound dependencies and classes that have inbound ones, and
that would be enough to compute coupling metrics.  But I was
wrong.  This modification is pretty useless, I can't think of
a valid use case.  But what the heck, it's in there already.
