Further simplified the default settings in
=DependencyFinder= and =query.jsp=.
The new defaults print the entire package-to-package
dependency graph, as opposed to the entire graph like
it was doing before.  This is so that new users, as they
start using the interface, can simply launch a query and
see something useful without using all the memory available
to render an immense graph.

I will expand the manual to include a tutorial with
sample queries and their results.

There was a rendering problem for =JTable=
under JDK 1.3.  I try to group rows in bands of three with
alternating background colors.  For some reason, under JDK
1.3, the cells in column 0 would not get the right background
sometimes.  This problem is gone under JDK 1.4.  Since this
is not breaking any functionality (it is just annoying), I
will recommend that you upgrade your JVM if it bothers you.
