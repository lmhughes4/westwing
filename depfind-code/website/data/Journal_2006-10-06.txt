Fixed bug where if the scope was reduced to an inferred feature of a confirmed
class, the class and its package ended up unconfirmed in the resulting
sub-graph.  =GraphCopier= and =GraphSummarizer= were using the current node's
confirmation status when copying a node a propagating it to its parent nodes
instead of creating accurate copies of the parent nodes in the first place.

Fixed the webapp's CSS stylesheet to treat visited links to inferred nodes
correctly.  The rules for =a:visited= and =a:hover= trump an explicit style
assigned via the =class= attribute.  I had to create explicit descriptions for
=a:visited.inferred= and =a:hover.visited=.
