A user asked for clarifications on the behavior of the advanced view in the GUI.
From the layout of the interface, in appears the checkboxes govern the use of
regular expressions for packages, classes, and features.  But they don't.  You
can think of it as a two-step process:

    1 Select nodes based on all the regular expressions.
    1 Summarize the selected nodes based on the checkboxes.

=GraphSummarizer= does both steps at the same time, but conceptually, this is
what is happening.

I never claimed the UI was very intuitive.  There is definitely room for
improvement.
