Removed =-plain= and =-raw= switches
from =ClassReader=, =DependencyExtractor=,
and =DependencyReporter=.  Their output was not adding
any new information and looked ugly.

Fixed =MetricsTableModel=.
=DependencyFinder= uses it to render dependency
distributions in a =JTable=.  A small glitch was making
it miss the last row of data.  I also renamed
=com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsGatherer.ChartSize()=
to
=com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsGatherer.ChartMaximum()=.

Normalized naming of human-readable text printers from
=PrettyPrinter= to =TextPrinter=.  In
=com.jeantessier.dependency=, I had to merge the two
classes.  I also got rid of
=com.jeantessier.dependency.UglyPrinter=.  As a
result, I could get rid of =-plain= and =-raw=
command-line switches and simplify the output of
=ClassReader=, =DependencyExtractor=, and
=DependencyReporter=.
