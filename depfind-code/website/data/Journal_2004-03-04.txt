Adjusted =PermissiveDispatcher= so it ignores HTML files.
I also gave it its own unit tests.

A number of people have been asking about why Dependency Finder does
not list line numbers where dependencies occur.  I added a section in
the User Manual that explains how the line number information in
=.class= files is so fragmented as to be useless.  I put it
under the "Limitations" heading.
