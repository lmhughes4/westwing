The flow of downloads has tarried.  But that's OK.  I'll get
another chance when the beta comes out (if I can get to it).

Worked on simplifying the UI in the web application.  Both
=query.jsp= and =closure.jsp= now have
a simple and an advanced form.  The advanced form has all the
options whereas the simple form only takes regular expressions
that apply to all packages, classes, and features.  I'm thinking
of relying on external cascading stylesheets, but I have to
check about browser support.  I suppose this is not really an
issue anymore, but I'll check anyway.
