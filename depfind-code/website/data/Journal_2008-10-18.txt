Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Testability-Explorer</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.10RC1-r34</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2.0-r85</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I have to rewrite the =&lt;testability&gt;= tasks in
=build.testability-explorer.xml= to bring it in line with their latest Ant
task.
