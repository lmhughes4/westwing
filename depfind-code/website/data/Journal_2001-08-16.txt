I made major changes in the =jt.dependency.Visitor=
and =jt.dependency.TraversalStrategy= hierarchies.  I
have consolidated the visitors under a single base class and
moved the complex traversal logic into a traversal strategy
implementation.

There is a bug with the new traversal strategy which does not
traverse the graph at all unless
=jt.dependency.TraversalStrategy.PackageScope()=
is true.  Likewise, feature nodes don't get visited unless
=jt.dependency.TraversalStrategy.ClassScope()=
is also true.
