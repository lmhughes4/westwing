Introduced =DifferencesStrategy= and started using it in
=DifferencesFactory=.  In the process, I noticed that I
never modified =FieldDifferences= to take into account the
change in value for constants.  I fixed it, but I'll have to also fix
=ClassReport= and the XSL stylesheet in
=DiffToHTML.xsl=.
