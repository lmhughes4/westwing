Pushed the logic for separating fully qualified class names into package name
and simple class name to the =Class_info= class, with tests.  Added tests for
=Classfile.locateField()= and =Classfile.locateMethod()=, including proper
handling of inherited package-visible methods.

Added =LoadAdapter=, a no-op implementation of =LoadListener=, so
implementations don't have to duplicate no-op methods just to fulfill the
interface.

Started Google Collections in spite of my reservations regarding JSR 305.  Next,
I want to start using Guice too.
