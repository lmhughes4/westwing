I change the root of the packages from =jt= to
=com.jeantessier=.  This comes as part of the preparations
to make this software open source.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Jean Tessier API</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>20011114</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>20011125</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
