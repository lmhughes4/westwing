Found a way to run my tests with JUnit 4.4 from the command-line.  I found
[[http://www.devx.com/Java/Article/31983/0/page/3][this article on JUnit4] on
the web and modified =textjunit= accordingly, and it worked just fine.
Essentially, it is this command-line:

    java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore $*

With a =CLASSPATH= that has all the right JARs on it.
