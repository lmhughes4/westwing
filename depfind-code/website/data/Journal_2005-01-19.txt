Tried =ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= with
=extract.jsp=.  It was a little overeager, skipping
directories without even looking if files in them had changed.  So I
modified it to not do anything special with directories and always
delegate to the underlying dispatcher.  Somehow, it doesn't seem to
really skip unmodified files, so I'll have to investigate further.
