Finished with the whole =MetricsConfiguration=
mess.  All I have left to do is adjust the measurement names
in =MetricsGatherer= and complete the descriptions
in =MetricsConfig.xml=

Next, it is time to fix SLOC and dependency metrics.  Then
I'll simplify the UI, write tons of docs, and the first beta
will finally be available by the middle of June.

Famous last words ...
