I added a filtering function to =OOMetricsGUI=.
With this feature, I can filter a set of metrics to only show
the rows that interest me, out of a large body of code.

There is a bug with the sorting function.  If a column contains
NaN values, only the segments between NaN values get sorted.  The
NaN values don't move and I then have islands of data, each one
sorted by itself.
