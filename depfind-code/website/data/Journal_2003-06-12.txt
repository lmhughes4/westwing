Minor correction in the documentation of Ant tasks.  When defining
the =CLASSPATH= for Dependency Finder, always put the
=classes= directory before the
=DependencyFinder.jar= file.

My download counters are still at zero, but so are others at
SourceForge.  I suspect that SourceForge has some kind of bug.

I am going to be on vacation for three weeks, starting this Sunday.
I will be back around the 4th of July.  I still have a patch to
produce before that.  I will do a 1.0.1 release upon my return.

I have been struggling with rewriting the JSPs and break them up
into headers and footers and navigation pages.  Maybe even use tags
for the processing and JavaBeans for the request parameters.  One
argument against doing this is that the JSPs provide examples of how
to use the classes in Dependency Finder.  I'm not fully decided yet.
