Another example sequence diagram for the call flow across composed visitors to,
this time to render a dependency closure as a call graph in text.  Click the

I wanted to completely separate the textual rendering from the traversal of the
graph, but I may not be able to do that.  The current =TextPrinter= makes
assumptions on the nature of the graph so it can remove "empty nodes".  I am not
sure in this logic belongs in the rendering or the traversal or somewhere else
altogether.  If it belongs somewhere else, this complicates the setup to do a
simple printout to text.
