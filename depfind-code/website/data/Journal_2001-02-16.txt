Renamed the extraction tool from
=DependencyFinder= to
=DependencyExtractor=.

Added =LinkMinimizer= and
=LinkMaximizer= visitors to control the
size of the dependency graph.  =LinkMinimizer=
removes redundant edges while =LinkMaximizer=
replicates edges.  The minimal graphs gives a more compact
representation, but traversal can be slowed down.  The
full graph takes up more space, but its traversal will
be more efficient when computing metrics such as
aggregated package dependencies.
