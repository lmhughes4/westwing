Adjusted all implementations of =LoadListener= to handle
the new events.  It is still a little quirky and I will need to fine
tune them later.

I also renamed some of the attributes in the =LoadEvent=.
What was the _filename_ is now called the _group_name_ and
what was the _element_ is now called the _filename_.  This
way, the naming reflects more closely the use for these attributes.

I have been considering removing =ClassDependencyCollector= and
=FeatureDependencyCollector=.  I am not using them anymore,
and =CodeDependencyCollector= does a much better job.
