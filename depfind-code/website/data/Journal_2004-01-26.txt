Yesterday, I forgot to refactor the JSPs to use the new
=SelectionCriteria= instead of the previous
=SelectiveTraversalStrategy= directly.  Of course, the Ant
task for compiling JSPs using Jasper has changed between Tomcat 4.1.27
and Tomcat 5.0.16, so I had to spend a fair amount of time getting my
custom Ant build script up to stuff.  After that, upgrading the JSPs
was pretty easy.

There was a thread on the
[[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/][praprog]] mailing
list about code inspection tools.  At first, I didn't want to mention
Dependency Finder because the original message asked for tools to
evaluate code style and unused variables/methods.  Dependency Finder
can't do much about style, and while it can find elements that are not
referenced directly, that does not necessarily mean they are not used.
They could be interface methods or things called via reflection.  But
then, someone else brought up JDepend, so I had to say something.
Some of the other tools mentioned:

    * [[http://pmd.sourceforge.net/][PMD]]
    * [[http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/][Checkstyle]]
    * [[http://jalopy.sourceforge.net/][Jalopy]]
    * [[http://www.clarkware.com/software/JDepend.html][JDepend]]

I haven't tried any of them myself, but some of the brochures
looked nice.
