Steve Kirk has been having problems analyzing =rt.jar=
from JDK 1.4.2_01 on Linux.  From the error message he sent me, it
seems the bytecode is screwed up.  One instruction tries to look up
entry 47105 in a constant pool that has only 445 entries.  It would
appear that the compiler generated bad bytecode.  In any other
software, I'd believe that.  But in the JDK itself?  I'll have him
send me the file so I can investigate this myself.
