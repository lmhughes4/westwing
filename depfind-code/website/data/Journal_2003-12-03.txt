Someone brought [[http://nounit.sourceforge.net/][NoUnit]]
to my attention.  From what little I read, they seem to be using a
=.class= file parsing library from
[[http://www.netbeans.org/][NetBeans]] to get a method call
graph.  I guess they then use logic similar to dependency closures to
figure out if methods are called directly from unit tests or if
indirectly, how many degrees are they removed from the tests.  Since
they only analyze =.class= files and then use XSL transforms
for rendering the information, they cannot take into account
conditional logic.  As far as I can see, the information can only be an
educated guess at best.  I think you'd be better off using a code
coverage tool like Clover or jcoverage to run the tests.  Maybe NoUnit
can give a quick estimate since you don't need to run the tests, and
that is worth something.
