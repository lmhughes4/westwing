Fixed =build.xml= to use =&lt;junit&gt;= and
=&lt;junitreport&gt;= tasks to run the unit tests and get a
nice HTML report.  It works fine on MacOS, but not on Windows XP, for
some reason.  I get an =OutOfMemoryError= no matter how much
memory I put in =ANT_OPTS=.

I'm also going to use spaces only for indenting
=build.xml=.  I was using combinations of tabs and spaces,
but it looks very strange in some editors that show tabs as four
spaces.  Eventually, I might do the same in Java files, too.
