Someone referred me to a Danny Diggs, from UIUC, who has a tool to detect
refactorings that are done to a library and can then replay them on client code
when new version of the library gets released.  This goes one step further than
=JarJarDiff= who can tell you if the API you relied on got changed; it can
actually modify your code to bring it in line with the new version of the
library.  A quick Google search didn't find any obvious matches for this tool,
though.

Someone pointed me to
[[http://code.google.com/p/testability-metrics/][testability-metrics]], a tool
that looks at cyclomatic complexity as a way to estimate the cost of testing
any given method.  It works off of compiled bytecode, just like Dependency
Finder, but uses [[http://asm.objectweb.org/][ASM]] for decompiling bytecode.
