Got started on a =TransitiveClosureEngine= to handle the
next version of transitive closures.  The engine should select a
starting point in the graph and incrementally grow a subgraph from that
initial set of nodes until some termination criteria is met.  This
could be that a given node is reached or that a certain number of steps
have been taken.

Added a link to the patch tracker on SourceForge from the project's
home page.
