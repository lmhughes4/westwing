I added ratio metrics in =jt.metrics.MetricsFactory=.

I now use instances of =java.text.NumberFormat= in
=jt.metrics.PrettyPrinter= to adjust the display of
numbers.

I played with using =Jikes= to compile the code
instead of =javac=, but the difference in compile
time was not worth the extra warnings (4 secs vs. 10 secs).

I now use the default compiler mode in =javac=,
=modern=, instead of =classic=.  I hope
this won't break the compatibility with JDK 1.2 VMs.
