Refactored =SelectiveTraversalStrategy= to create an actual
=ComprehensiveTraversalStrategy= to use in defaults instead of an unconfigured
=SelectiveTraversalStrategy=.  I figure the indent is more explicit this way.

Changed =SelectiveVisitor= to reuse the superclass implementations when it is
appropriate.  This meant changing the tests because the superclass was using
double dispatch to pass control to the delegate visitor and the original
implementation of =SelectiveVisitor= was calling the delegate directly.
