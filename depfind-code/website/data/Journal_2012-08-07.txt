Found a Grails plugin, [[http://grails.org/plugin/standalone][Standalone App Runner]], that packages the webapp in a
JAR file with a choice of Tomcat or Jetty, so you can run the app simply by executing the JAR file.  I was considering
a distribution with Jetty a while back and this would be a really easy way to do it.  All I have to do is rewrite the
webapp as a Grails app.
