Finally got around to running
[[http://www.thecortex.net/clover][Clover]]
on Dependency Finder.  Overall coverage is at 52.2%.  About 16 tests
in the =com.jeantessier.metrics= package failed because the
code instrumentation from Clover messed with the expected metrics.  I
have put the preliminary results
[[clover/][here]].  I can move the tests for
=com.jeantessier.commandline= package from the
=main()= methods to proper JUnit tests.  That should raise
coverage somewhat.  I'll look further into Clover for what else I can
get from it.

I came across someone who was actually trying to extend Dependency
Finder.  This person had downloaded the source code, modified the
classes directly, and recompiled Dependency Finder with the
modifications.  While this might have seemed like a good idea, it
will create problems later on when I release an upgrade to Dependency
Finder and this person will have to merge their custom changes with the
new version of the files.  It would be much better if they had put
their custom code in separate classes, in their own custom packages,
and compiled them against =DependencyFinder.jar=.  When a
new version of Dependency Finder comes along, they can just drop it
in.
