Renamed the =JarDiff= tool to =JarJarDiff=,
at a friend's recommendation.  I adjusted the output so that it
lists methods by signature instead of name.  It actually outputs
XML and has a XSL stylesheet for converting to HTML.  I don't have
one for text, yet.

I've added a tool to compute the transitive closure of elements.
It is named =DependencyClosure=.  If creates a sub-graph
of the dependency graph by following outbound dependencies.  By
starting on one class, you can find out all the classes that are
used directly or indirectly by that class.  It uses the same scoping
and filtering engine as =DependencyReporter=.

I've added another tool to compute dependency statistics, such
as the number of inbound vs. outbound links.  It is named
=DependencyMetrics=.  I also renamed =Metrics=
to =ClassMetrics= in the process.
