I was all set and ready to go with the 1.0 beta release and
"billfan" strikes again.  He keeps locking the CVS repository and
keeping me from doing anything in there.  This is very frustrating.
I tried to contact him, but my emails bounced.  Each time this happens,
I have to open a ticket with SourceForge admins and wait until the
next day for them to get to it and blast his locks.

"billfan", if you're listening, *GET OUT OF MY REPOSITORY!!!*

Thanks to "billfan", you all have to wait until tomorrow for the
beta.
