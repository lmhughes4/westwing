I finally figured out why Fit behaved differently between my desktop
and my laptop.  It turns out they had a different version of Fit.  I
must have downloaded Fit 1.0 to my laptop by accident.  Anyway, I
tried diff'ing the =fit.jar= and noticed they were
different.  I followed up with a quick run of JarJarDiff, just to be
sure, and there it was, lots of signature and code changes.  I copied
Fit from my desktop back onto my laptop and _voil&agrave;!_ it
now works like a charm.

Also wrangled =DoFixture= into doing what I wanted it to
do.  It works great for dealing with simple values.  Now, I need to
figure out how to call =Node.addDependency()= and pass
=Node= values from the Fit tables.  I guess I will need one
of those fabled =TypeAdapter=.
