Refactored =ClassfileLoader= and its subclasses.
The decorators are now hidden inside the
=ClassfileLoaderEventSource= class, so clients of the
package don't have to bother with which decorator to instantiate.
This paves the way to including progress measurements in the
=LoadEvent= passed in =LoadStart()= and
=LoadElement()= events.  This way, I can have either
a "percent complete" or a progress bar as things are loading.
I might even be able to have an elapsed time and a predicted
remaining time.

Documented the methods of =LoadListener=, but I
must revise the description of the various attributes and under
which cases each one has a value.
