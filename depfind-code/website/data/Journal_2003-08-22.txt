Came up with a sequence diagram to better understand the
interactions between various =ClassfileLoader= instances.
This will help me organize the interactions to deal with recursive
processing of ZIP-like files.

I had to explode the =ClassfileLoader= instances to show
how the behavior is spread across the inheritance hierarchy.  This
yields a cleaner diagram, thanks to the fact that each class is
responsible for one and only one thing.
