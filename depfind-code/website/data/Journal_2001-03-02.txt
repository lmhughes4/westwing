After running the tools on themselves, I reorganized
the package hierarchy and simplified it greatly.

I added XSL stylesheets for converting dependency graphs
to text and HTML.  Each stylesheet has three version:

    1 Whole graph
    1 List only outbound dependencies (show nodes that are dependent on others)
    1 List only inbound dependencies (show dependable nodes, i.e., depended upon)

I added shorthand options to =DependencyReporter=.
I also added shorthand =.bat= files.

I adjusted =DependencyExtractor= to scan the
bytecode using =CodeDependencyCollector= instead
of limiting itself to traversing the constant pool and looking
at signatures.

I refactored =Collector=, making it an interface
with a base implementation (=CollectorBase=) and
creating an inheritance ladder with =Visitor=.

I found yet another bug with =byte= as a signed type.
There may be others still waiting to manifest themselves.
