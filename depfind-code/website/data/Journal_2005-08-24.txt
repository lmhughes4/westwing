Turns out my manual tests for =JarJarDiff='s filtering
were using the wrong filter files.  I am glad to report that the
filtering function is working just fine.  And now, I have tests to
prove it.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>5.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>5.0.1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
