I did a quick check to see if I can still compile
Dependency Finder with JDK 1.2.2, but I can't anymore.
I use =java.util.Collections.singletonList()= in
=com.jeantessier.commandline.MultipleValuesSwitch=
and a new constructor for
=javax.swing.JRadioButtonMenuItem= in
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.gui.DependencyFinder=
that takes an instance of
=javax.swing.Action=.  Given the context in
which these happen, I don't see how I can write around
them in a clean way.

So I'm probably just going to drop support of JDK
1.2.2 and ask people to use Dependency Finder with
JDK 1.3 and above.
