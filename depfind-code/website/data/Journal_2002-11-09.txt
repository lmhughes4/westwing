Wrote a new unit test for =TransitiveClosure=.
Right now, it requires a maximized graph to be useful.  I want
to have it accept any graph, like I did for =GraphCopier=
with =GraphSummarizer=.

Running the tests reminded me that I still have a bunch of
unit tests for metrics to fix, with regard to the fact that I
moved to JDK 1.4.
