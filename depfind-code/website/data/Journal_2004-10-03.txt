As I developed =SymbolList=, I realized that the way it
ties a =LoadListener= and a =Visitor= was common
to a few classes and that each one was reimplementing it, always in the
same manner.  I decided to get rid of this code duplication by putting
it in a =LoadListenerVisitorAdapter=.  From now on, if you
want a visitor to get called as classfiles are loaded, you will be able
to wrap the visitor in a =LoadListenerVisitorAdapter= and
then register it as a load listener.
