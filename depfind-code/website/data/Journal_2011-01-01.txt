Trying to write unit tests for =Field_info= so I can tackle
[[https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1766486&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][bug 1766486]].
Because I decided, a long time ago, to create everything from data streams in
constructors and strictly mirroring the data structure from the classfile
specification, I end up having to mock a lot of things to setup a test for a
field with a string value.  There are times when you question some of the
earliest design decisions.
