Played with JDK 1.6.  It screwed up some of the tests because of changes in the
language and the =.class= file format.  For instance, there is a new
=StackMapTable= attribute for which I could not find any description on the
Internet.  Of course, the JDK 1.6 compiler puts one such attribute in the
bytecode for =test.main()=.  Right now, Dependency Finder represents it using
=Custom_attribute=, but it threw off
=TestVisitorBase.testVisitCode_attribute()= which wasn't expecting custom
attributes.  The few bits of text I could find on Sun's website that talk
about =StackMapTable= also refer to a =StackMap= attribute, which I had never
heard off before.  Makes me wonder what else is lurking in the shadows.

Since I do most of my Dependency Finder development on a Mac these days, it
will still be a while before I can deal with JDK 1.6 issues.

Someone found a bug with the XML generated by =JarJarDiff=.  When it breaks
down the declaration of constants, it shows the value for that constant if it
can, which, in the case of strings, can contain characters that should be
escaped in XML.  I suspect it might be an issue for other XML generators too.
