Someone pointed me to
[[http://code.google.com/p/google-singleton-detector/][Google Singleton Detector]],
a static analyzer that looks for singleton and produces nice graph output.  They
use [[http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/][GraphML]] to render the graphs and
[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products%5Fyed%5Fabout.htm][yEd]] to view them.

The same people that offer yEd also have a UML tool called
[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products_ydoc.htm][yDoc]], but you have to
pay for that one.
