Someone asked about listing methods in a code JAR file that are not called from
a separate test JAR file.  They put their code in one JAR file and their tests
in another one, and they want to use Dependency Finder to find what methods are
not called directly from the tests.

I figured out a way by listing symbols and using them in an exclusion list, but
=ListSymbols= does not have that switch.  Adding it is not too complicated, but
there are quite a few tests to adapt.  I have to immerse myself in that code
again.  It's been a while.
