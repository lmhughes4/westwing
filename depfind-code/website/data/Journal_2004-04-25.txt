Finished =Metrics.Empty()=.  It recursively looks at any
submetrics and also looks at all measurements, ignoring those that are
not visible.  The stylesheet is also shaping up.  I want to take the
same approach with my other HTML generators.

Now, =OOMetrics= skips _empty_ metrics by default.
You have to pass it the =-show-empty-metrics= to see all
metrics like before.

I haven't updated the documentation yet.
