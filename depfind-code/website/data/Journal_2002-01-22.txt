I fixed the minimize and maximize discussion.  It had broken links and I had to
regenerate the HTML from the source MS Word document.

While I was at it, I fixed the Documentation section too.  It had a few
obsolete links.

Someone brought [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/jdiff/][JDiff]] to my
attention.  I've given it a cursory look and I still believe that my work is so
much better.  ;-)  More on this later.  I'll have to create a section on the
_competition_.
