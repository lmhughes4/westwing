Release the Dependency Finder tutorial at last.  I managed to crop
all my screen captures in a consistent fashion.  At the last moment, I
noticed that a tool tip was on one of the GUI captures.  Too bad.

I started thinking about an OO Metrics tutorial too.  Setting up a
custom configuration is non-trivial and could use some kind of
introduction.
