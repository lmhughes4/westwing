Found a possible bug with =MartinConfig.xml= that was the result of a typo in a
regular expression.  Where it says =[\^.]= (a caret or anything), it should have
said =[^\.]= (anything but a dot) instead.  I will have to write some conclusive
tests to verify the behavior of this config before I can go ahead and fix it.
