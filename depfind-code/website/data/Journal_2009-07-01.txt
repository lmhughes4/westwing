Happy Canada Day!

Someone asked why Dependency Finder was not picking up dependencies on runtime
annotations.  The answer is simple: I haven't implemented that part of Java 1.5
support yet.  The code is there to read in annotations from the =.class= file
and include them in the =Classfile= structure, but I don't do anything with it
just yet.

I implemented support for rendering runtime annotations in =XMLPrinter=.  It's
a start.  I didn't get around to handling all the different types of element
values, though.
