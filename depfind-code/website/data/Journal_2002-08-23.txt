Found some articles
(one by [[http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/Principles%5Fand%5FPatterns.PDF][Robert C. Martin]])
and a tool for the Resource section.  The article by Mr. Martin
gave me the idea of providing a custom metrics configuration
with the metrics he describes in the article, using the same
abbreviations.  I might need more powerful computational measurements
to handle the equations.

I've put up some [[Samples/][sample outputs]]
so you can see what they looks like.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>3.7</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>3.8</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
