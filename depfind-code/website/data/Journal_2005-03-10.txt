Added a checkbox to =extract.jsp= to choose between
updating the current graph (using =Monitor=) or extracting a
new graph from scratch.

Started putting a =favicon.ico= in the web application
and on the website.  I tried to cheat by using
=logoicon.gif= and using =&lt;link&gt;= tags in
the HTML.  It works fine with Firefox but I couldn't get it to work
with Internet Explorer.  I tried to create a =.ico= file
with some free editor, but I still couldn't get it to work.  Maybe it
is a caching problem.
