Configuring FitNesse and HtmlFixture still eludes me.  I need some
kind of tutorial on how to set them up together.  And once that is
done, how do I put the tests under source control?  Let alone running
them automatically from an Ant script?  That includes starting a web
container, deploying the web app, and connecting to it.
