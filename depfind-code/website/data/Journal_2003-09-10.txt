Added an extraction timestamp to the JSPs' footer.  I was tired of
always having to manually type the URL to =extract.jsp=
every time I wanted to know if I could rely on the data.

Someone has mentioned that API diff reports still list modified
methods even when the class is deprecated.  Would it not be better if
a class that is now deprecated simply repress all further modifications
to it?  I say no.  Even though the class is now deprecated, it is
still part of your supported API until it is completely removed.  As
such, its modifications should still be listed since users of the
library are likely to still be using the class.

Upgraded my testing environment from Tomcat 4.1.24 to 4.1.27.
