Played with SourceForge resources.  Someone mentioned that I
might be able to use SourceForge shell server to test Unix launch
scripts.  The shell server does not have compilers and connecting
through SSH is tedious, so I will not do this on an extended basis.
But I did setup the website as a checkout from CVS.  Now I need to
figure out how to setup the cron job so it updates itself
automatically.

I think I've got it...

Yup.
