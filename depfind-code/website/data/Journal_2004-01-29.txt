Dependency Finder is three years old!

I have been thinking some more about tracking inter-JAR
dependencies.  I could come up with some kind of =GroupNode=
that would be the parent of =PackageNode=.  But this
assumes that packages are wholly contained in one location, which is
not necessarily the case.  An alternative would be for groups to be
made of arbitrary sets of classfiles, kind of like the group
functionality in =OOMetrics=, where classes can be part of
more than one grouping.  Some groups represent packages while others
could represent JAR files.  Still needs more thought.

The [[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/pragprog/][praprog]]
mailing list had a discussion on dependency cycles and some of the
theory behind cycle detection and resolution.  Looks like I'll need to
hit the books to keep myself current.  :-)
