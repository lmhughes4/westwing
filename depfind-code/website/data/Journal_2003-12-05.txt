Steve Kirk sent me his =rt.jar= file.  I tried =ClassList= on it with logging
turned on to see exactly where it fails.  I also discovered
"=javap -c _classname_=" which dumps the instruction sequence for each method.
I compared the sequence from my logs with the one from =javap= to see if I'm
interpreting the bytecode correctly.

It turns out the class =com.jeantessier.classreader.Instruction= had the wrong
size for the instruction "=fstore=".  It listed it as 1 byte when it is really
2 bytes.  This threw off the bytecode reader and eventually led to some runtime
exception that crashed the program.  I have fixed it and published a patch for
it as
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D855085&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435886][patch #855085]].

I find it had to believe that it took over two years for this bug to surface.
I'm very tempted right now to write a tool that counts the number of times each
instruction is present in a give codebase.  With it, I could see if maybe some
other rarely used instruction is also be wrong in
=com.jeantessier.classreader.Instruction=.
