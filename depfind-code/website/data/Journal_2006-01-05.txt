Studied the impact of logging a little further.  If I remove all
logging in =CodeDependencyCollector=, I can save about 15%.

Worked at breaking down the Journal into individual wiki-like files.
The large, single file HTML was becoming too unwieldy.  IntelliJ IDEA
was stalling every time I opened a new tag.  With the wiki-like
notation, it will make writing entries a little easier since I won't
have to type all those HTML tags anymore.  I still need to figure out
how to rebuild the HTML file from the individual pieces.
