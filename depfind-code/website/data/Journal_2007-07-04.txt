=Monitor= is too aggressive when multiple versions of a class show up in a
codebase.  This can happen on large projects that depend on many third-party
software that each depend, in turn, on some popular package.  For example, both
GWT and HttpUnit come with their own version of Xerces; if my project uses
both, =Monitor= is going to see Xerces classes twice when I try to analyze my
project.  When I designed =Monitor=, I was assuming that it wouldn't see the
same class name twice within a session.  Now, I probably want to merge
dependencies within a session and still remove everything between sessions,
regardless of whether =Monitor= is setup for open or closed sessions.

Refactored =Monitor= to use parameterized generics.  Removed code duplication
in =TestMonitor=.
