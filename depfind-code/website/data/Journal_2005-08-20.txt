Started fixing =JarJarDiff= to remove all the parts that
dealt with the level of documentation as separate entries in the XML
report.  The next step will be to use the lists from
=-old-validator= and =-new-validator= to trim the
report itself, not with an XSL stylesheet.  I will do this work on a
separate branch and merge it in when I'm done.  The branch is named
=published_API=.

Fixed =textjunit.bat= and =junit.bat= to allow
for spaces in the =JAVA_HOME= environment variable.
