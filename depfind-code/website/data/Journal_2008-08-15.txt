Fixed =ListDiff= so the =-old-label= switch defaults to the value of the =-old=
switch, the way it does for =JarJarDiff=.  And the same for =-new-label= and
=-new=.  Added tests for the Ant task versions of =ListDiff= and =JarJarDiff=

Refactored the changes to the CLI version of =JarJarDiff= by pulling them up to
the base class =DiffCommand= so they can be shared with =ClassClassDiff=.

Fixed tech docs accordingly.
