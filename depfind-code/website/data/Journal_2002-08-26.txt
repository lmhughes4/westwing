Worked on the documentation a bit.  I tried to clarify how
scoping and filtering work.

I found out that =CodeDependencyCollector= treats
dependencies coming from a class' static analyzer as if the
dependencies emanated from the class itself.  This means that
dependencies from the static initializer to features show up as
class-to-feature dependencies, something I said in the manual
did not exist.  Now I must decide if I'm going to amend the
documentation or treat the static initializer like a feature.
And if the latter, how am I going to name it?  I'm thinking
maybe =package.Class.{}= or something similar.
