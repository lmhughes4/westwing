Finished revamping of JSPs.  I changed the labels around the
controls for showing inbound or outbound dependencies.  Instead of
saying "inbounds" and "outbounds", they now show "=&lt;--="
and "=--&gt;=" respectively.  Hopefully, this will make it
a little clearer what each one does.  I will need to find a way to do
the same in the GUI.
