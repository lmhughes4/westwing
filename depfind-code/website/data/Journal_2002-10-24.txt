Got some more ideas regarding layout of dependency
graphs.

Found interesting thing that JDK 1.4's =javac=
does with method calls.  The bytecode now points to the actual
type of the reference now, instead of the last class in the
inheritance hierarchy to implement the method.

Cleaned up =com.jeantessier.classreader.XMLPrinter=
to better print field accesses and method calls.

Added manifest information to the JAR file.
