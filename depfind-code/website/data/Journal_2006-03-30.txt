I want to add metrics to find long identifiers.  I could have length, in
characters, of class names, package names, and feature names.  With some clever
parsing, I could also compute length in number of words.

Modified code using =ClassfileLoader= and =CommandLine= to use the generics
version of Collection classes so they can use the new =for()= loop to iterate
over collections.
