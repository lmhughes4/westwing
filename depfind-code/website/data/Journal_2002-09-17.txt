Compressing by looking at consecutive lines does not
work.  I changed the algorithm in =ListDiffPrinter=
to be a little more thorough.  It can still have some
problems with inner classes, but that only result in a
little too much output; nothing is lost.  I'll live with
it for now.

Also fixed =ListDiff.bat= which was missing
a JAR, now that =ListDiffPrinter= uses Jakarta
ORO.
