Fixed some Fit tests that were missing the =fit.Summary= at the end.

Looked further into why Fit ignores a cell with only spaces in it.  This is
causing the Fit tests for =ClassFinder= to fail because the =-indent-text=
switch has ="    "= (four spaces) as its default value and Fit keeps thinking
the expected cell value is the empty string.  It turns out that somewhere deep
inside Fit, it decides to use a =ResultValueAdapterByStringCompare= for this
column (=getDefaultValue()= returns =Object=), and it uses =fit.Parse.text()=
to parse the table cell, and =text()= calls =String.trim()= before returning
its value.  Darn it!  Now, I'll have to find a way to supply a custom
=ValueAdapter= instead that knows how to keep a cell value as explicit spaces.

Simplified =CommandFixture.switches()=.  It does not need to wrap its return
value in an =ArrayFixture=, FitLibrary will take care of it for you.
