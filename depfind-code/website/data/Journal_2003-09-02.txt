Added a more permissive =ClassfileLoaderDispatcher= that
tried to use =ZipClassfileLoader= on files of unknown type.
I also made this new, more permissive dispatcher the new default.

Finally figured out how to use @link tags for =javadoc=
and fixed the one file where I was using it: the package description
for =com.jeantessier.classreader=.

Also edited the website's introductory page to adjust some of the
phrasing.
