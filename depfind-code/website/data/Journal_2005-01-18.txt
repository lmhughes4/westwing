Added more tests for =DeletingVisitor= to make sure that
deleting nodes with inbound dependencies does not remove them from the
graph but only makes them as referenced elements.

Added flags to the web application to control whether or not to
display the =source= and =file= parameters on
=extract.jsp= and =load.jsp= respectively.  This
can help in debugging where a given installation is getting its data
from.
