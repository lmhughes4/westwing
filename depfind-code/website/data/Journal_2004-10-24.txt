Adjusted =TransitiveClosure= to use two engines, one for
upstream and one for downstream closures.  The two engines share the
same factory, so the results are all in a single graph, like it used
to be with the old processing.  Still, a lot of tests are broken and it
will take some time to fix them.

I was able to test my theories about separate summarization on
=TestTransitiveClosureWithTestClass=.  Mostly successful,
but one test ends up with too many dependencies because
=GraphSummarizer= is a little too eager.
