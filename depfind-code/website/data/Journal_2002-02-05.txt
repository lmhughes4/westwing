I need a release plan.  I've had a number of ideas lately for
new features and I need to scope what's doable and what's not,
and have some idea of when I can expect the release.

I fixed =TransitiveClosure=.  I also added to it a
feature where it can now follow inbound dependencies in addition
to outbound ones.  Maybe this will become handy somehow.  I'm
thinking of limiting the depth of the closure exploration, though.
And finally, it now has two modes of operation: one where it only
records the first dependency that led to a =Node=, and
another where it records all such paths.

I adjusted the code so that Log4J is initialized from
=log4.properties= located on the =CLASSPATH=.
I thought about putting the file in =DependencyFinder.jar=,
but decided against.  If someone is familiar with Log4J, they can
edit the configuration file and adjust logging to their liking.
It took a lot of hard work to figure it out.  I had to follow all
the steps below, pretty much in that order:

    1 RTFM
    1 RTFM
    1 RTFM :-)

I temporarily removed =xerces.jar= and =xalan.jar=
from the web application WAR file.  This dramatically reduced its size.
I also added =deploy= and =undeploy= targets to
the =build.xml= file for Tomcat.
