Tools docs.

Figured out how to get Ant's =&lt;cvsTagDiff&gt;=
task work from "now" instead of "last midnight".  It turns out
that adding the time to the date screws up how Ant generates
the resulting CVS command.  There is an open bug report with
Apache, so maybe they'll fix it in the future.  While we are
waiting, I had to add the quotes in the tag's attribute myself.

I'm thinking of getting rid of the =-plain= switch
to some of the CLI tools.  It is useless.  I should be able to
get rid of =com.jeantessier.dependency.TextPrinter=
by the same token.  We'll see about this last one.
