Toyed with the idea of removing deprecation-related entries from
=JarJarDiff= reports, in addition to the
documentation-related ones I removed two days ago.  In the end, I
decided to keep them since they impact the compilation messages you get
when building code.

Further modified =JarJarDiff= to use
=Validator= as a filter instead of the two documentation
parameters it had before.  Now, it uses a new
=ComprehensiveValidator= by default but if supplied with
the =-filter= switch, it uses a
=ListBaSedValidator= instead to limit the report to
selected elements.  I have to modify =ListBaSedValidator= to
throw an exception when its input file is missing.  I am not finished
yet.  There are no tests for filtering and when I pass in the switch,
the resulting report is empty.  This shouldn't take too long to sort
out.
