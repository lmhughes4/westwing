In =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=, I can use an XSLT Extension
in Xalan-Java to limit the report to a subset of packages defined in a
separate file.

In =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=, I need to filter out
declarations that only remove =abstract=, =final=,
and =static=, instead of filtering in declarations that
add it.  This way, I might be able to trap changes in =extends=,
=implements=, and =throws=, as well as return type.
