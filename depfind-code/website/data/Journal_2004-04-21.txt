=DeprecationReporter= is not flexible enough, so I found
a way to adjust =DependencyReporter= so I can use it
instead.  I'm adjusting the printers in the
=com.jeantessier.dependency= package so they can all hide
inbound or outbound dependencies or empty nodes.  In due time, I'll be
able to remove that business logic from XSL stylesheets.

I still have to document the new switches.

I will physically remove =DeprecationReporter= very soon,
before anyone really starts to use it.

I also want to write an HTML printer so I can generate the HTML
directly from within the application.  Then I could use it in the web
app to have nicer output with hyperlinks.
