Updated the code coverage analyses on the website with runs against
Release 1.1.1.

Got my free license for

Googled for "Dependency Finder", out of curiosity, and found two
interesting hits.

The first one was
[[http://www.headwaysoftware.com/][reView]].
I had already stumbled on it a while back and I must say the demo on
their website was pretty impressive.  It has a lot of what I'd want to
see in a graphical UI for Dependency Finder.  They sell licenses for
$1,999 each.  Whew!  Their brochure has a lot of great arguments for
managing dependencies from a financial point of view.  And since
Dependency Finder is free, it's an even *better* deal.

The second one was
[[http://hackystat.ics.hawaii.edu/hackystat/docbook/index.html][Hackystat]].
This one is a metrics framework that has Dependency Finder as one of
its tools for getting information about a codebase.  It is from the
University of Hawaii.  They use a dependency graph, which they post-
process, to extract coupling information about programming elements.  I
think they might have an easier time collecting their data if they used
=OOMetrics= instead.  I'll have to get in touch with them
and see if see if that is the case.
