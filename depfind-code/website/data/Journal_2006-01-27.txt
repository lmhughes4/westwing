I have been wondering how to replicate the current behavior of =extract.jsp=
under [[http://www.opensymphony.com/webwork/][WebWork]].  A WebWork action
terminates before the JSP tied to its result is even started.  The action has
no way to stream data that would end up embedded in the result, the way
=extract.jsp= streams parsing information to keep the user notified of its
progress.

But I found that the JSP can use the =&lt;ww:action&gt;= tag to invoke another
action while the JSP is rendered.  Maybe I can use this to have a dummy action
launch the =extract.jsp= and from within it, call the real action that extracts
the graph and stream progress to the output stream.
