Cleaned up how =XMPrinter= deals with instructions that have a value embedded in
them, such as =bipush= and =iconst_1=.  Also made it show the destination
address of =goto= and jump instructions.

Augmented =TextPrinter= so it also shows the bytecode, similar to what
=javap -c= does, including the exception handling.

As I was looking at coverage reports to make sure I covered all the cases in
printing instructions, I was reminded that some =ExceptionHandler= structures do
not have a catch type, meaning they trap everything and apparently that is the
bytecode presentation of =finally= blocks.

I also realized that I was reading offset values for =goto= and branch
instructions as unsigned values, when they are actually signed.  The same goes
for embedded values in =bipush= and =sipush= instructions.
