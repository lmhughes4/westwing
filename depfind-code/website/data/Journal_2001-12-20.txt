I've been considering switching from Log4J to the
JDK 1.4 Logging API. I decided against it after reading
[[http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/critique.html][Ceki G&uuml;lc&uuml;'s comparison of the two]].
I've played a little bit with the Logging API and it was very
difficult to introduce a new format for the logged messages.
I believe Log4J is more flexible and easier to use.

This being said, I still need to work out the
=-verbose= and =-trace= switches so
that they properly adjust the logging configuration.

I also need to compare the speed of the tools when
they use Log4J as opposed to =com.jeantessier.log=.

I got rid of the =JAVA_BIN= and
=JAVA_EXE= environment variables.  I should be
able to use only =JAVA_HOME= like everybody else.
