A coworker requested that pages from the web app be bookmarkable.
The easy solution is to replace the "method" attribute of
=&lt;form&gt;= tags in the JSPs.  The URLs can get pretty
large.  Just the parameter names for =advancedquery= make it
600 characters long.  With web proxies that can truncate URLs at 1K,
that leaves about 400 characters for specifying regular expressions.  I
haven't checked it in yet.
