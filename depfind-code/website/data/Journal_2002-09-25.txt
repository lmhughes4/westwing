Found a problem with Xalan.  For some reason, it won't
recognize my extension for =PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl=
for the =Validator=.  It used to work just fine.
I can't find anything in the documentation regarding
changes on to specify extensions.  The release notes hint at
improvements regarding detection of extensions, but there are
no specifics.

I have downgraded Xalan from 2.4.0 back to 2.3.1.

I've had an idea for a new web app where people can
upload their JAR files and whatnots and get custom graphs
for the duration of the session, or something.  More on this
later.  In the meantime, I've put it in my release plan.
