=ListDiff= can now compress the resulting list.
This means that if, for instance, a class is in a list, it
will remove entries for methods of that class from the list.
The same goes for packages and their classes.  Just call it
with the =compress= switch.

I changed the published list to use with
=PublishedDiffToHTML=.  It makes more sense to use
the old list, since the goal is to notify customers of the
changes that possibly break backwards compatibility.
