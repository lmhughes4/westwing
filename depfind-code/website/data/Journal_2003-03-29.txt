I decided not to make an Ant task for =ClassReader=, but
I will need one for =ListDiff= to complete the workflow
outlined in the manual.  Now I'm going to pay for not separating behavior
properly.  =ListDiff= has all the behavior and a utility
class that is in the =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.cli=
package.  How am I going to reuse this from the
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder.ant= package?
