Looking a little further into renaming symbols.  There are over
3,000 methods, but from those I can remove constructors, which will
retain their initial capital, and methods that already follow the Java
convention, such as =toString()= and
=equals(java.lang.Object)=.  But I must also account for
fields, where I use all lowercase with underscore to separate words.
Constants in all caps don't count, and fields with only one word are
just fine.  So I wrote a little Perl script to list what's left and
ended up with 2,611 symbols that need renaming.

That still leaves local variable to take care of.  I'll need to
tweak =com.jeantessier.metrics.MetricsGatherer= to find a
way to list them.  It currently counts them, but doesn't keep track of
their names.  Then again, maybe a simple classfile printer could do the
trick.

Phase I: got started on =com.jeantessier.classreader=.
I'll check it in, and when I'm done, I'll release beta 2 and see the
reaction it gathers.
