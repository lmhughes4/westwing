There is a problem with =DependencyFinder=: it ignores
=.class= files passed in explicitly.  Somehow, the
dispatcher seems to think it should ignore the files.  This is because
the dispatcher is asked twice about the file: once as a group and once
as an individual file.  Since the file hasn't changed between being
looked at as a group and as a single file, the
=ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= tells the loader to ignore it the
second time around.  Maybe =ClassfileLoaderDispatcher=
needs both a =dispatchGroup()= method and a
=dispatchFile()= method instead of the current single
=dispatch()= method.
