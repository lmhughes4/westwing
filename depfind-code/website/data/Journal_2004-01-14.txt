Latest SourceForge tallies show downloads only for old release files:

    * =release 20020127 of "DependencyFinder.zip"=
    * =release 20020127 of "DependencyFinder.src.zip"=
    * =release 20020711 of "DependencyFinder.war"=

These coincide with the first time these names were used, when I
removed the release label from the file names.  I suspect that some new
logic for tallying downloads at SourceForge looks at filename now
instead of what maybe used to be either a combination of release ID and
filename or some form of file ID.

Actually, looking at the links on the download page, the links for
the various =DependencyFinder.zip= files are identical.  I
wonder what people are downloading?  The most recent file or one from
over 18 months ago?  A quick download at least reassured me that they
are indeed sending the most recent file, but that's regardless of which
link I click.  I cannot download any of the previous versions; I always
end up with the most recent file.

So I always download the _most recent_ file by a given name,
but the download gets tallied with the _oldest_ file by that name.
Strange.  I hope this is temporary and the SourceForge people fix this
soon.  Otherwise, I'll have to reinstate the version label in the
filenames (which might actually not be a bad idea).
