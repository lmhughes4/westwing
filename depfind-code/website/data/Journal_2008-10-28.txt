Started writing support for annotations, TDD-style.  I found a cool way to use
jMock to mock the input stream from which data structures are read.  This way,
I don't have to create an arbitrary bytestream, all I have to do is mock the
calls to =readInt()= and so forth on the data stream.

While I was trying to mock a =DataInputStream=, in which all methods are
=final=, I found out about the =DataInput= interface, which is much better
(and I can mock it, no problems).
