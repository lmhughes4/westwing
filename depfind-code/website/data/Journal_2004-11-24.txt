I've been struggling for some time with how to deal with start
scripts for Unix.  I also find it tedious to maintain a large number of
scripts that are identical except for one identifier.  At first, I
thought of having some kind of _install_ program that could link
up the right version of the right script, but I was hesitant at making
the installation procedure more complex.  A friend suggested to
generate the scripts at build-time.  This solves two problems:
maintaining nearly identical files and having start scripts for Unix.
Now, I can generate both and select which ones get in the ZIP file for
Windows and which ones get in a new compressed TAR file for Unix.

Right now, I'm generating a ZIP file with =.bat= scripts
only and a separate compressed TAR file with shell scripts with no
extension only.  Neither one has all the scripts but they are otherwise
identical.  I could have the two files be identical and have both sets
of scripts, and possibly give the shell scripts a =.sh=
extension.  But I hesitate since I don't think this is the standard in
Unix-land yet.

Code contribution!

Joe Fisher submitted a new version of the GUI's
=SaveFileAction= so it reports its progress to the user.  I
have incorporated it into the codebase, it will ship with the next
release.  Thanks, Joe.  You get to be the very first external
contributor to the project.
