Tried to use Dependency Finder to analyze some Groovy code.  But the way that
Groovy mediates method calls so it can treat getters like properties makes it
difficult (impossible?) for Dependency Finder to see the real dependency.
Instead, it sees dependencies to Groovy's internal method resolution code.

I installed the latest version of
[[http://www.yworks.com/en/products%5Fyed%5Fabout.htm][yEd]] only to find out
its XML parser cannot read the GraphML files I generate with
=DependencyGraphToyEd=.  Something to do with forward references.  I guess I'll
have to rewrite it to process write out all nodes before it writes edges.
