Simplified the command-line interfaces to the major
tools (=DependencyExtractor= and
=DependencyReporter=).

Fixed =Reporter= to assume it is operating
on a maximized graph.  This simplifies the processing and
minimizes traversals.  This might have also solved the
printing problems I was experiencing.

Fixed a bug where a feature could get a dependency
on its class or package, and vice versa.  The same
thing was happening between classes and packages.
