Started playing with a code coverage tool.  They gave me a free
license because Dependency Finder is open source.  So far, it looks
interesting; it consists of Ant tasks to instrument code and gather
measurements.  Check it out on the 
[[http://www.thecortex.net/clover][Clover website]].
I'll publish the coverage report for Dependency Finder when I have
one.

It turns out the problem with Ant's &lt;xslt&gt; is well known.  It
is a bug with the version of Xalan that ships with JDK 1.4.1.  To fix
it, you have to upgrade the JDK's Xalan; the best way of doing this is
with the =java.endorsed.dir= property.  I'll document it
in more details either in a bug or on the help discussion board.

Dependency Finder is starting to show up on Java indexing sites.
Just do a search for "_depfind_" and find out for yourself.
