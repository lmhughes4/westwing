I thought of a new way to use =JarJarDiff=.  So far, I
have talked about how you can use it as a producer of software
libraries to monitor the evolution of the published interface you
expose.  But another usage is as a consumer of software libraries,
where you want to know if a new version of the library introduced
changes on the part of the library that you use.  I am putting
together detailed instructions on how to use Dependency Finder to
automatically compute which part of the third-party library you are
using and use this information to filter the output of
=JarJarDiff=.  More on this later.
