Changed all the JarJarDiff variations to use the new
=DifferenceStrategy=.  Each has a new =level=
parameter to tell it which strategy to use.  Level can either be a
predefined constant, =api= for
=APIOnlyDifferenceStrategy= or =code= for
=ComprehensiveDifferenceStrategy=.  In addition, users can
set it to the name of a class that implements
=DifferenceStrategy= and that has a default constructor;
the program will instantiate it and use the instance to analyze
API differences.  I might so the same thing for the selection of
printers in many of the tools.
