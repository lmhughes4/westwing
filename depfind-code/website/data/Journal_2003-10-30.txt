Fixed =MaximumCapacityPatternCache=.  It turns out that
=Perl5Util= use a second cache internally which is
initialized with the pattern cache's capacity.  This additional cache
pre-allocates memory proportionally to the capacity, in my case
proportionally to =Integer.MAX_VALUE=, or about 2 billions.
I changed my cache to use a hard-coded value of 20.  That should be
enough to keep things going.

I added my new cache in a few other =Perl5Util= instances
where they might run into many regular expressions.  I had to create a
new package, =com.jeantessier.text= for the ORO-related
class.

Added =xml-apis.jar= and =xercesImpl.jar= to
the web application's WAR file.

Fixed =junit.bat= and =textjunit.bat= to use
=xml-apis.jar= instead of the former
=xmlParserAPIs.jar=.
