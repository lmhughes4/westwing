Updated the samples to add 1.0 beta data.

I had been having problems with the ZIP files that come out of the
builds.  For some reason, I could not see their contents using WinZIP
and could not extract them.  Other tools, such as =unzip=,
=jar=, and even Emacs did not have any trouble.  For some
time, I thought this was a problem between Java-generated ZIP files
and WinZIP 8.1.  It turns out that Ant was the culprit.  They even had
an open bug report about it.  It got fixed in the latest release, but
it is too late for the 1.0 beta release.  I hope people can make do
with =jar= for the duration of the beta.  Future releases
will work with WinZIP as expected.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.5.2</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.5.3-1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
