Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Tomcat</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>5.0.16</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>5.0.25</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I also came upon a new UML tool called
[[http://objectclub.esm.co.jp/Jude/jude-e.html][Jude]].
It has decent sequence diagrams but only supports UML 1.4 yet, not UML
2.0 with the nice ball and socket notation for interfaces.  Maybe I
can use Poseidon for clas diagrams and Jude for sequence diagram, at
the cost of maintaining two models.
