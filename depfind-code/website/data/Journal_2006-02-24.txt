Changed =CodeDifferenceStrategy= to compare instructions instead of the raw
bytes.  The next step will be to make instruction comparison smarter.

Also added =Hex.toString(byte[])= to make it easy to log byte arrays.
Previously,  =Hex= could only write to =OutputStream= or =Writer=, which
forced traces to write bytecode to a =StringWriter= in order to log it.  Now,
=Hex= uses a =StringBuffer= instead, which should speed things up a bit.
