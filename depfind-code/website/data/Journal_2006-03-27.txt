Created a Fit test to try to capture the dependency cycle in the Visitor
pattern.  Adjusted =CycleDetector= to drill down packages and classes in its
search for cycles.

Added =CycleComparator= to order cycles within a detector to ease testing.
Short cycles come before long ones.  Cycles of the same length are ordered
according to the lexical ordering of the nodes in their path.
