I have found a silly bug in =com.jeantessier.dependency.TextPrinter=
where it was not following the Inherited Behavior pattern in
some of its methods.  This was slowing down the printing of
dependency graphs tremendously (by a factor of 60 for analyzing
Dependency Finder itself).  It is all fixed now.
