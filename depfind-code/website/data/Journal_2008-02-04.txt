Worked on getting access to =Signature_attribute= information in relevant
programming elements (=Classfile=, =Method%5Finfo=, and =Field%5Finfo=, forgot
about possible =InnerClass=).

Added tests for _index_ attribute of =LocalVariable= and =LocalVariableType=
and to make sure =XMLPrinter= renders it, using jMock.

Added information (and tests) about _varargs_ methods.
