Pretty much done.

In =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=, I now use an XSLT Extension
in Xalan-Java to limit the report to a subset of packages defined in a
separate file.  The XSL stylesheet has a default value for the filename,
and I should be able to pass in a value from the command-line.  I can
now trap changes in =extends=, =implements=, and
=throws= clauses, as well as in the return type of methods.
