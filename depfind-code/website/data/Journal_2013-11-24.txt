I tried to upgrade from Grails 1.3.7 to the latest, 2.3.3.  It proved to be more than I could handle straight out of the
box.  There have been many many profound changes in Grails since version 1.3.7 and I might have to start from scratch.
Lucky for me I haven't had time to get very far in my Grails integration.

On a sadder note, I haven't really kept up with my environment and I realized that I can no longer compile Dependency
Finder.  Somewhere between computer upgrades and OS upgrades, Perl and Java have changed and my code no longer works.  I
will have to find the time somewhere to figure out what's changed and fix it.
