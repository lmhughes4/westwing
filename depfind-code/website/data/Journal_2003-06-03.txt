More fixes for the quotes in the =.bat= file.  This time,
I am quite confident that they work fine.

Ad hoc testing of the printer modification show that the memory
footprint went down by roughly 80% and the processing time remained
pretty much the same.  This is nice.

I added a new tool to the web app to provide dependency metrics the
same way that the CLI and the GUI do.  I also added navigation controls
to move between graphs, closures, and metrics.  In the process, I moved
=com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsReport= to a
=java.io.PrintWriter= instead of a
=java.lang.StringBuffer=, like I did for other printers
yesterday.

Added the =web/= directory to the source archive
=DependencyFinder.src.zip=.

Fixed =com.jeantessier.dependency.MetricsReport= that did
not interpret inbound and outbound dependencies correctly.
