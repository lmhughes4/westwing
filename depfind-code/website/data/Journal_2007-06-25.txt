Extracted common code from =DependencyCycles=, =DependencyClosure=, and
=DependencyMetrics= and put it into =DependencyGraphCommand=.  They load and
merge all the graphs before they can start processing.  =DependencyReporter=
benefited also, but to a lesser degree because it optimizes the processing of
graphs as they are being loaded instead of waiting for one big graph of
everything.
