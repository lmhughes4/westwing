More refactoring for the =ClassfileLoader= event
model.  I've added a concept of session, basically a call to
=Load(Collection)=.  This will allow me to start
measuring how long extraction is taking and maybe even make an
estimate has to how much longer it'll take.  In the meantime,
I have "percent completed" measurement in place.

I'm thinking of having one more release before the beta.
This would let people out there use the latest features and
bug fixes without having to wait for the user guide.  One
thing that I would like to release quickly is the new, simpler
user interface.
