Updated the example for =LinkMinimizer= and
=LinkMaximizer= and merged it with the User Manual.

I also had a idea to use a =Writer= in the various
=Printer= classes.  This would ease the resource needs
of various command-line operations since the tools would not need
to hold all the output in memory.  Anyway, I'm just thinking about
it at this time.
