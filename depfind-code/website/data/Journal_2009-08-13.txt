Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>4.6</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>4.7</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

The new [[http://junit.org/][JUnit]] introduces a new concept called
[[http://github.com/KentBeck/junit/raw/23ffc6baf5768057e366e183e53f4dfa86fbb005/doc/ReleaseNotes4.7.txt][_rules_]].
They are essentially interceptors for tests and a new extension mechanism for
JUnit, now that tests don't have to derive from =TestCase= anymore.  This looks
promising.  They re-implemented expected exceptions and you can now supply
matchers for more precise matching of exceptions thrown by the test methods.
Rules appear much more flexible, but they are still poorly documented.  It is
unfortunate that the javadocs bundled with JUnit 4.7 do not include the
documentation of already provided rules.
