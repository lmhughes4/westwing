Someone brought
[[http://www.jayasoft.fr/org/modules/ivy/overview.php?][Ivy]]
to my attention.  It is a package for analyzing dependencies and
producing reports with integration into Ant, Maven, Cruise Control, and
even Eclipse.  I couldn't understand the sample reports on the website,
and I don't think it offers the same kind of dynamic interaction
capabilities as Dependency Finder.  It is good that there is slowly
more and more tools to support object-oriented design.

Tech docs.
