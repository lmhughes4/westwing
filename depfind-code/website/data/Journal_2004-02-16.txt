Someone at work brought
[[http://www.touchgraph.com/index.html][TouchGraph]] to my
attention.  It's a graph package for complex graphs that lay themselves
out.  You can collapse nodes and stretch things around.  It looks very
cool and maybe I could make use of it in Dependency Finder for some
kind of rendering of dependency graphs.  I looked at the code on
SourceForge, but there is no documentation and I don't have the time to
investigate further right now.  Maybe later...
