I fixed a bug in the package =jt.dependencyfinder.classreader=
to process unknown or custom attributes in the =.class=
file, such as those generated by the Microsoft compiler.

I also fixed bugs in =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl= dealing
with restricting the processing to public or protected features,
as well as correctly detecting changes in visibility from protected
to package or private.
