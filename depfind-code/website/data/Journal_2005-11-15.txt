Started a new =com.jeantessier.dependency.Visitor= to look for cycles in the
dependency graph.  It seems that many people out there who are interested in
dependencies really want to detect cycles.  I still think that not all cycles
are necessarily bad, but maybe at least listing them can be of some use.  You
definitely want to avoid circular dependencies between large-scale components,
but one component might be implemented as many, tightly coupled, packages.
Since Dependency Finder is not aware of organizing principles beyond the
package, it's usefulness at detecting unwanted cycles will be limited.

Further refined the webapp's =style.css=.
