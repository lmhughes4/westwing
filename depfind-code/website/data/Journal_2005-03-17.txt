Added =windowtitle= to =&lt;javadoc&gt;= target so the Javadocs have a proper
window title when viewed with a browser.

Final clean up for using =logoicon.gif=.

Since October, I've been struggling for a good term to distinguish nodes in the
dependency graph that match elements that were actually extracted versus those
that were merely referenced, but not extracted per se.  Back on [[2004-10-08]],
I came up with _referenced_ versus _concrete_.  Both are troublesome because
they have other accepted meanings in closely related contexts, such as
_concrete class_.  Today, I finally came up with a better replacement:
unconfirmed references produce _inferred_ nodes until the element is actually
extracted, at which point the node gets promoted to _confirmed_.

Made sure that =GraphCopier= and =GraphSummarizer= maintain a node's confirmed
vs. inferred status across graph copies.
