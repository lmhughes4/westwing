Paired with Nicolas Wettstein to add filtering capability for =LoadEvent=
listeners.  It was nice to pair program with someone on Dependency Finder for a
change.

The hierarchy looks like this:

[[../images/FilteringLoadListenerHierarchy.gif]]

This will help with filtering certain classes based on regular expressions.
The filters extend the decorator so they can be composed with other
=LoadListener= implementations, such as =LoadListenerVisitorAdaptor=, for
example.
