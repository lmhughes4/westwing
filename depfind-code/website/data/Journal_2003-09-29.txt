Someone wrote to me saying they had they couldn't figure out the
measurements names from their short acronyms in CSV output.  I pointed
them to the metrics configuration XML document, which lists the long
name next to each measurement's short name.  I also pointed out that
the text and XML outputs list both side by side.

Back when I was preparing version 1.0, I toyed with the idea of
having part of the documentation describe each measurement the same
way that I have detailed descriptions for each tool in Dependency
Finder.  I gave up it when I figured that the long names were already
fairly indicative and keeping this document in sync with the
configuration file would be a lot of work.  Maybe I can still add a
simple description section in the descriptor...
