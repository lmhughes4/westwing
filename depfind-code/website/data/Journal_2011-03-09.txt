Tried to convert =extract.jsp= to a Grails GSP.  All the scriptlets are really
getting in the way.  And the same problem I had with WebWork is surfacing again:
=extract.jsp= streams its progress directly to the browser and I haven't quite
found how to do this in these frameworks.  Maybe a taglib can help.
