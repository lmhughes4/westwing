I have fixed all the unit tests!

I was not happy with the way that most measurements
inherited from =MeasurementBase= and implemented
=NumericalMeasurement=.  This led to a lot of
duplicate code and the resulting class diagram was hard
to read.  So I created =NumericalMeasurementBase=
to store the common code and provided some sensible default
method implementations in both abstract classes.  Now, there
is no longer any duplicated code and the class diagram is
simple and obvious.
