Changed =Classfile= to track methods with a simple =Collection= instead of a
=Map=.  This way, bridge methods don't trample each other.  But I use a
=LinkedList= internally, so methods are no longer sorted by signature.  All the
tests are passing for now, but suspect it will impact the logic in =OOMetrics=
and/or =JarJarDiff=.

I also tried to resurrect the WebWork web app, with limited success.  I want to
move it squarely into Struts2 instead of clinging to WebWork 2.2.6.
