I adjusted =GraphCopier= and =GraphSummarizer=
to reduce the noise in their scope output.  They used to output the
whole package of any node that was in scope.  This often produced extra
output that would obscure the answer to the query.

The new =GraphCopier= maintains a separate =NodeFactory=
for scoped nodes and filtered nodes.  Only nodes in the scope are
created using the scoping =NodeFactory=.  This cuts away
a lot of extraneous information.

This has unfortunately broken =TransitiveClosure=.
