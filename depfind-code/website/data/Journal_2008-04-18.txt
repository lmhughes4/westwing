I had to change my SourceForge password because I had forgotten it.  A little
while ago, my password expired on SourceForge and I had to pick a new one.  Now,
it's been a few weeks since I last used it and I couldn't recall what it was.
So I changed it again to something new.  Hopefully, I will remember it this
time.
