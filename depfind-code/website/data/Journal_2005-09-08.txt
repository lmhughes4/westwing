Started work on =DifferenceStrategy= to encapsulate the
behavior behind =Differences.isEmpty()=.  Got through the
simple tests for fields, constructors, and methods.

Ran a quick test with a large JAR file: removing all calls to Log4J
reduces extraction time by 50%.  I should look into more discretionary
use of logging to make the application more responsive, specially for
large codebases.
