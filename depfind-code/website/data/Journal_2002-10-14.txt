I'm dropping support for JDK 1.2.2.  I upgraded my
JDK 1.3 from 1.3.1_01 to 1.3.1_05.  I also started playing
with JDK 1.4.

This is interesting, now.  JDK 1.4 ships with some basic
XML support, including a version of Xerces.  But it looks
like it's an older version than the one I'm using, because
it requires me to explicitly specify the system property
=org.xml.sax.driver=.  I need to dig further to
figure out which version they're shipping and how I can
force it to use the latest Xerces that I ship with
Dependency Finder.  Maybe some day, in the far future, when
I don't support JDK 1.3 anymore, I can stop shipping Xerces
with Dependency Finder altogether.  But for now, I'm stuck.

Maybe I can weasel out of it by requiring users to install
JAXP 1.2 from Sun.  The documentation claims that JDK 1.4
ships with JAXP 1.1.  Maybe JAXP 1.2 uses something close to
the latest Xerces; and it also includes Xalan!  I will
investigate further.

Also, the compiler in JDK 1.4 behaves slightly differently
from the one in JDK 1.3.  The result is that the unit tests
are breaking because the compiled classes don't have the
same number of features.  I will have to either revert back
to JDK 1.3 or update the unit tests.  I haven't quite decided
yet, but I'm leaning towards the latter.

I also seems that JDK 1.4 has problems with Log4J too.
More on this later.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Xerces</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.1.0</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>2.2.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
