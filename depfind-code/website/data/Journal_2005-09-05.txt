I am stuck.  On two fronts.  With JarJarDiff, I can't seem to see a
way to insert some kind of strategy in the difference engine to choose
between all differences and only those I judge might break backward
compatibility.  With the HTML-ization of the web app output, I can't
seem to find a clean way to go from preformatted text output to
hyperlinked HTML.  This is frustrating.
