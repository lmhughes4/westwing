Fixed the use of =id= attributes in =classfile.dtd= to use =index= instead.  The
attribute =id= has special meaning in XML.

I realized that local variables can be active for only a portion of a method's
execution and that the VM can reuse positions in the local variable table for
different variables whose scope does not overlap.  That significantly
complicated =LocalVariableFinder=.  It had to take into account the position of
the instructions trying to locate a local variable and what local variables are
active at that position in the code.  To complicate matters further,
instructions that set local variables, such as =istore=, are such that the
variable does not really exist at that instruction position but starts
immediately after.  Couple that with the =wide= instruction and things get
pretty nasty pretty quickly.

Minor refactoring.
