I have been looking at the
[[clover/][output]] from
[[http://www.thecortex.net/clover][Clover]].
It includes a few metrics, such as:

    * Number of classes
    * Number of methods
    * Lines of code (LOC)
    * Non-comment lines of code (NCLOC)

It is interesting to compare them to the metrics from
=OOMetrics=.  First, the number of classes are the same.
But this is where the similarities end.

Second, Clover counts the number of methods explicitly defined in
the source code.  Dependency Finder counts all methods in the compiled
=.class= file, which includes default constructors added
by the compiler and _synthetic_ methods.  So the Dependency
Finder count ends up being slightly higher than Clover's count.

Third, Clover's LOC counts all lines in a file, indiscriminate of
whether the line is code, a comment, or even empty.  Its NCLOC count
limits itself to lines that actually contain code, but it includes
lines with non-executable code, such as a single closing curly brace
(i.e., '=}=').  Dependency Finder's SLOC uses information
from the compiler, when it is run with the =-g= switch, to
count the number of lines with really executable code.  It then adds a
few more lines to account for class, field, and method declarations.
It overshoots a little because it even counts implicit constructors and
=synthetic= elements, but it stays in the ballpark.

Overall, it is just curious that Dependency Finder comes up with
more methods, but less overall lines of code.
