I reinstated the Visitor pattern in the
=jt.dependencygenerator.classreader=
package with a vengeance.  It turned out to
be useful in other areas of the =.class=
file as well.  Visitors can now explore the
whole =.class= file, including fields,
methods, and attributes.

I moved the =ClassReader= tool from the
=jt.dependencygenerator.classreader=
package to the =jt.dependencygenerator.tools=
package.

The extractor now reads the entire =.class=
file.

It has problems reading from compressed JAR files.
It seems to be OK with uncompressed ones.  Maybe I can
use the =java.util.jar= package to read the
whole byte stream in memory before starting the processing.

Handed a copy of the code to Jeff Chan.
