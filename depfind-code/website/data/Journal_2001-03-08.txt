Added the =JarDiff= tool to compare different
versions of the same codebase, using the
=jt.dependencyfinder.classreader=
package.  This first version is pretty stupid and writes
only text output from =main()=.  It needs to
be refactored to produce XML, and then use XSL stylesheets
to generate text and HTML reports.

I've added many utility methods in the
=jt.dependencyfinder.classreader=
package to help in interrogating classes.
