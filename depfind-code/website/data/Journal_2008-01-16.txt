Clamped down on public constants for access modes in =.class= files structures.

I am very tempted to extract interfaces from all the classes that make up the
=Classfile= structure and put their implementation into a separate package.  I
could possibly rewrite part of the tests with [[http://jmock.org/][jMock]] and
have more control on what gets tested without having to jump through hoops to
create test classes that expose specific behavior.
