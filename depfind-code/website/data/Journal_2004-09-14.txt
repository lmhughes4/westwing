Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Ant</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.6.1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.6.2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

Revived the CVS diff reports using Ant's CvsTagDiff task.  I'm also
trying to have Ant generate change log reports, but the
=ssh= authentication is getting in the way.  I need to use
=pserver= access but it seems =cvs= won't let me
use it on a directory that was not checked out with
=pserver=.  So now I have to keep two copies of the
development tree just so I can generate reports.  This is annoying.

I also looked at =StatCvs= from SourceForge.  It still
needs its own copy of everything, so it might not help all that much.
But it has nice little charts.  :-)
