Wrote =LocalVariableFinder= to help find the =LocalVariable= of a
=Code_attribute= from its index in an =Instruction=.

Removed =getCode()= from the =Instruction= interface.  The implementation can
still hold on to the =Code_attribute=, but that's an implementation detail, and
does not need to be part of the exposed interface.
