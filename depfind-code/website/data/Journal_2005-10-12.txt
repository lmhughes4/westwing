Reworked the way =DifferencesFactory= determines code
differences.  It is now all done by the strategy and the factory only
sets a flag in the appropriate =CodeDifferences= instance.
I had to adjust =DifferenceStrategy= in order to expose
=isCodeDifference()=.  I eventually would like for constant
value and code differences to have their own instance of
=Differences= instead of just being flags.  Objects can
hold information about the nature of the difference.

I had an idea of using a chain of command pattern instead of my
current strategy pattern for =DifferencesFactory=, but that
would make it much more complicated to insert user-defined strategies.
So I'll stick with my current design for now.
