Finished the Ant task for =DependencyExtractor= and
also wrote those for =ClassMetrics=,
=DependencyReporter=, and =JarJarDiff=.
I decided to stick with the Ant naming convention and use
=destfile= for the output attribute.

Introduced a new tool, =ClassClassDiff=, which compares
two classes, even if they don't have the same name.  I found a need
for it when a renamed one class to work on temporarily and wanted
to see later on what differences I had introduced.  The class was
too large for me to do this with regular diffs.
