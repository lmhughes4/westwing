Fixed the parameters for =DependencyClosure= in both the
CLI and Ant task. But at least the CLI version seems to still have
problems: the switch
=-start-includes /^com.jeantessier.dependency.NodeFactory/=
still matches anything with =NodeFactory= in it, as opposed
to only names beginning with it.

Someone filed bug
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1058905&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][#1058905]]
where =PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl= still uses the old method
names from before the naming change.  I fixed the bug and issued patch
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1060021&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435886][#1060021]].
