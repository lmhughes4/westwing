I have been thinking about adding another set of JSPs to the web
app to duplicate the functionality in =DependencyMetrics=.
I am also thinking of putting in a navigation structure to switch
between the query, closure, and now the metrics tools.  I would also
like to pass the parameters around so you can run a query in
=query.jsp= and click on "metrics" to get the dependency
metrics relating to the subgraph issued from the query: number and type
of nodes, number of dependencies, etc.  I might put it in the 1.0
release if it does not take too long to do.  Now, all I need to do is
figure out how to render a nice navigation structure.

I have also been toying with the idea of a second web app to provide
the functionality of =OOMetrics=.  I'm still not clear if a
separate web app is really required.  The main difference between the
two is that the current =extract.jsp= does not hold on to
parsed =.class= files.  It discards them as soon as it has
extracted their dependencies.  The metrics tools read everything in
first and then go about their business.  So the memory footprint is
larger, which might become problematic.
