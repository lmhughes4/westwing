Adjusting wording on the GUI to make it a little more intuitive.
Also played with fonts to get something close to Courier in graph

Had a "teachable moment" with a colleague today.  I think he finally
saw the benefits of using Dependency Finder when dealing with a large,
intricate codebase.

I'm going to make a beta release while I finish updating the
documentation.

I also need to start working on a new printer for closures.  The
normal graph printer makes results too hard to read.
