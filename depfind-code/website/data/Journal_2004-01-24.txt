I started revamping the dependency closure computations.  First, I
need to extract node selection logic to its own class and refactor
=SelectiveTraversalStrategy= to use the new
=SelectionCriteria= to determine both scope and filter.
This is getting to be quite an undertaking, but it will help the new
closure logic figure out starting nodes and stopping conditions.
