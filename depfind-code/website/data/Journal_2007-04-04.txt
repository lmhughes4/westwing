Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>6.0.4</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>6.0.5</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

But it seems IntelliJ IDEA on a Mac doesn't get the environment variables the
way it does on Windows or Linux.  As a result, Ant targets don't execute
correctly.
