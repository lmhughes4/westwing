Added =Instruction.getIndexedLocalVariable()=, =Instruction.getOffset()=, and
=Instruction.getValue()= to help with text rendering of instructions.  Used them
to make traces in =Code_attribute= and instruction data from =XMLPrinter= more
useful.

Simplified =Instruction= tests by using jMock and putting many of the tests
methods in one test class.

Bad news for Dependency Finder: I just got Tomb Raider: Underworld!  >:-)
