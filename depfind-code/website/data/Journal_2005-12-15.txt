Finally settled to a format for my Fit tests.  I got rid of my early
experimentations and kept only the most comprehensive ones.  I also
posted a suggestion for a fix to FitLibrary to bring it in line with
Fit 1.1.  We'll see how that goes and if it gets incorporated.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Log4J</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.2.8</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2.13</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
