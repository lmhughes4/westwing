Refactored =CanAddDependency()=.

Fixed references in slides for the tutorial.  I need to think
about this before I publish it on the website.  I used the slides
from a previous presentation, but this would mean that I would have
to come up with some new material if my submission to JavaOne is
picked up.  Then again, I would have to come up with some new stuff
anyway!
