Someone claimed that =ListDocumentedElements= was missing
some elements, "whole classes".  They wouldn't give me more details.
How can they expect me to find and fix a potential problem if they
won't even help me recreate it?  It'd be one thing if they were some
unrelated party working on proprietary code that they can't show me,
but this was a coworker.  We work together on the same code.  They just
didn't want to be bothered.  So if anybody out there ever sees this
too, where =ListDocumentedElements= is missing some valid
elements, please let me know.  Until now, it has worked just fine for
me, so I'll just assume that my coworker had a bad configuration.
