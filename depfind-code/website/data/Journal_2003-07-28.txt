Added a copy-only feature to =DependencyReporter= (both
on the CLI and the Ant task), =DependencyFinder= and
=advancedquery.jsp=.  When turned on, the tools always use
=GraphCopier= to answer queries.  This is useful if you
want a class-to-class graph with only inheritance, for instance.  I
still have to document this new feature in the manuals.

I added navigation controls to =extract.jsp=.  I was
tired of always editing the URL to go to the query JSP after
extracting a graph.  The navigation is the same as on the other JSPs
and I adjusted the title at the top of the page to match that of the
other pages.
