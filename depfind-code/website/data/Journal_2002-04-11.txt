I have figured out how to work around the expression size
limitation in =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=.  I have added
a =full-signature= attribute to =declaration=
nodes in the DTD for differences.  This keeps the size of the
expression somewhat lower, but it is still a behemoth.

I am now done with the higher-resolution validation feature.

The XSL stylesheets for =JarJarDiff= seem to work
fine.  I have added one more to only list documentation level
changes.  I also need to test =DiffToExternal= on a
real-life sample.  I am still not clear as to which validation
list to use: the one generated from the old code, the one generated
from the new code, or a merge of the two.
