Moved the GUI's =LoadListener= implementations to use the
new =VerboseListenerBase=.  Instead of mingling it in the
action class, I moved it out into delegate listener classes.  Again,
classes should do one thing only, and do it well.  A lesson to
remember.

Now that the GUI, the CLI, and the Ant tasks have access to the full
group processing stack, I can work on to how use that information in the
progress messages.
