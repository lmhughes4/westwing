Refactored =Classfile= to rework =locateField()= and =locateMethod()=.  I now
have a special constructor to allow testing.  I marked it with a comment while I
decide whether or not I want to pull
[[http://code.google.com/p/google-collections/][Google Collections]] into the
project so I can use its =@VisibleForTesting= annotation.
