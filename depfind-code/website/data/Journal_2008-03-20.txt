Added =-compact= and =-indent-text= switches to =ClassFinder=.  =-indent-text=
has four spaces as its default value, and it's throwing off the Fit test.

Changed =ClassMatcher= so that it uses the group information from the
=endClassfile= event instead of relying on the group stack maintained by
=LoadListenerBase=.

Back on [[2006-03-13]], I had put up "Related links" banners powered by Google
to some of the pages.  They stopped working a while back and they were only
showing an empty box.  But today, I noticed that they started saying "Error".
So I took them down.
