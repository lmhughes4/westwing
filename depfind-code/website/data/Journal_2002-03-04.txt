I've simplified how =TransitiveClosure= determines
whether or not to follow inbound and outbound dependencies.  But
I still have problems with weird interactions when following both
inbound and outbound dependencies at the same time.

I've created =closure.jsp=, a web application
interface to =TransitiveClosure=.

I've added the appropriate switches to
=DependencyClosure=.

I fixed a typo in =DiffToExternalHTML.xsl=.
