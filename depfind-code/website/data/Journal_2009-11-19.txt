I've been setting up another development on a new laptop.  I couldn't find the
version of [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/fitlibrary/][FitLibrary]] that I'm
using with Dependency Finder.  I'm using =FitLibraryRunner20060116=, but the
oldest version available is =FitLibraryRunner20070217=.  There were some API
changes, starting with this version, that are incompatible with my code and I
have not found a workaround.  I am going to have to include my copy of the
2006-01-16 version with the source for Dependency Finder if people want to run
the Fit tests.
