Added a script for doing XSL Transformations.  It uses
Apache's Xalan.  Now all I need are some XSL stylesheets.

=DependencyReporter= is working fine, except
that the command-line is starting to exceed DOS limits.
I will need to create an XML configuration document if
I want to process complex queries.

I fixed =DependencyExtractor= so that it can
read from JAR and Zip files.

I found yet another bug caused by things use index 0 in
the constant pool to represent special cases.  There may be
others still waiting to manifest themselves.
