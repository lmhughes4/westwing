Someone asked how to find which JAR contains a class using
Dependency Finder.  I created a new tool, =ClassFinder= that
uses the group stack from =VerboseListenerBase= to collect
that information and print it out.

They also asked for the same information for packages.

Found out about using =title= attributes to make popup
hints in HTML instead of weird Javascript.  I'll make it part of the
redesign of the JSP pages.
