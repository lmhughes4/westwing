Found a minor bug with =ClassReader= where it does not reset the internal
counter it uses to print a constant pool in text mode.  If I ask it to print
two classes, the indices of the second class pick up where the first one left
off.

I tried to write an integration test first, but there is so much indirection
involved between =TextVisitor= and =Classfile= that it would have required quite
a bit of setup and would have ended up fairy brittle.  So I settled for a small
unit test of =VisitorBase.visitConstantPool()= instead.

Fixed a constant duplication in =data2atom.cgi= where it was referencing
=Journal.cgi= directly instead of the more generic =$DOCUMENT.cgi=.
