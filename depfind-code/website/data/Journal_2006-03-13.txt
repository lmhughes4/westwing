Added new experimental "Related links" banner from Google to selected pages on
the website.  It does not pay like Google's AdSense, but it might provide
useful links to people who visit the site.  I added it to the following pages
to start with:

    * Introduction (between main text and quotes)
    * Resources (at the top)
    * Journal (at the top)

I also added a copy of the open source license for Dependency Finder on the
website.  Someone was inquiring and they couldn't find it on the web.  It has
always been included in the distributions, but it can't hurt to have it posted
visibly too.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JUnit</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>3.8.1</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>3.8.2</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
