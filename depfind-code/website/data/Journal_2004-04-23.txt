Shifted strategy.  I'm going to use =OOMetrics= instead
of a simple dependency graph.  This allows me to have automatic counts
tallied at the class and package level.  But the changes are extensive.
I need variations on the =AccumulatorMeasurement= and the
ability to ignore _empty_ metrics and focus on the actual
offenders.

Also started playing with XSLT stylesheets for converting metrics
from XML to text and HTML.  I also experimented with using CSS to
format the HTML.  But with the introduction of external stylesheets,
it raise the question of where am I going to put them?  I can provide
defaults in =etc/= or simply embed the stylesheet in the
generated HTML.  I'm not completely decided yet.
