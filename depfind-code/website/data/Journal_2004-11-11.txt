I decided not to mess with the UI on the GUI application.  It would
require massive reorganization to account for the different semantics
of the UI elements between closures and the other functions.  I will
need to rework it anyway when I have a new renderer for closures, I'll
take care of it then.  I want to finish this release.

Also cleaned up the build file a little more.
