I found a tool that a lot of the same features of
=DependencyFinder=, but with a GUI and can also
handle C++.  I read a review in
[[http://www.sys-con.com/java/][Java Developers Journal]].
The tool is called
[[http://thesmallworlds.com/][Small Worlds]] and it
sells for around $1,750.  The screenshots are really nice.

I need to write to JDJ, maybe get an article out of it.
And I need to follow up on Martin Fowler and Bob Martin too.

I put (most of) the website in CVS as a new module.

I also had an idea for a possible layout of classes, by
package, for a dependency graph.  Classes in a package are laid
out in a circle, forming a cluster.  The clusters are they laid
out in a larger circle.  This way, one can zoom in on a cluster
to explore dependencies within a package.  If you zoom out far
enough, inter-package dependencies dominate and packages with
lots of dependencies stand out.
