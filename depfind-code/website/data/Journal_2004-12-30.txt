Came up with a much better way to narrow down a diff to the API
actually used by some software.  I use =ListSymbols= first
on the library and then use the symbols to extract a subgraph from the
calling software.  By using
=DependencyReporter -show-empty-nodes=, the graph only has
the nodes for used symbols.  Converting this subgraph from XML to text
with =DependencyGraphToText= gives me the subset of symbols
that are used in the software.  Pass this shorter list to
=PublishedDiffToHTML= and that is all there is to it.
