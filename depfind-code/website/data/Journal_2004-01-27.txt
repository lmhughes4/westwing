Started working on a tool to list packages by JAR file in a given
codebase.  I'm thinking I could turn this into a way to track classes
by their location, be it a loose class file or as part of a JAR file.
I have had a few requests for tracking inter-JAR dependencies and this
could be a step in that direction.
