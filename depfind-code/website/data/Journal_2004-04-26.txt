Tried the new filtered dependency metrics report on some production
code at work.  Gave it 1GB heap and it crashed after 4 hours with an
out of memory error.  Filtering in accumulators is too expensive.  The
elementary measurements (IICM, OIP, ...) still gather all dependencies
before we start filtering and they use up all the memory.

So I moved the filtering to =MetricsGatherer= instead.
This way, I can take out dependencies at the source.  I only had time
to do filter lists now.  I'll look at scope lists later.  Also, right
now the resulting report is broken down by dependency source.  Showing
them broken down by target is going to be more difficult, but I can
use =MetricsFactory.All_xxx_Metrics()= to get at metrics
for deprecated symbols outside the codebase.
