Added code difference information to the XML reports that come out
of JarJarDiff.  The XSL stylesheets are giving me trouble.  They can't
seem to pick up the new XML tags.  Strange.

It turns out that my CVS configuration in IDEA missed two test data
files the other day.  I guess I'll stick to SmartCVS for checkins.
