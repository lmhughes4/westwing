I could depend only on JDK 1.4.2 instead of 1.3.  This way, I would
not have to ship Xalan with Dependency Finder.  I could even go further
and use Java Logging and Regex instead of Log4J and ORO respectively.
Then, Dependency Finder wouldn't need any third party software.

A while back, I compared Log4J with Java's Logging API and preferred
Log4J.  It is more flexible and easier to configure.  It would feel
strange to move away from it now.

I chose ORO because it supports pretty much all of Perl's very rich
regular expression language.  From what I understand, its coverage
even outdoes Java's Regex.  But Dependency Finder only uses a small
subset of that language, which is equally covered by both package, so
I could easily switch.

So switching to JDK 1.4.2 would give me access to both the Logging
and Regex APIs.  It also includes a complete copy of Xalan.  JDK
1.4.1 had a bug in its Xalan, but 1.4.2 is all better.

I wonder how many people out there currently use JDK 1.3 or a
version of 1.4 that is below 1.4.2.  If I switch now, how many users
will not be able to follow?  If I don't switch, then I need to keep
dragging Log4J and ORO along.

CVS on SourceForge is still out.
