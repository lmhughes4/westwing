I fixed a problem with inner classes.  =OOMetrics= was
counting all inner class entries in the InnerClasses class attribute.
This included references to inner classes in other classes, resulting
in a count that was higher than reality.  It now restricts itself to
actual inner classes of the current class, resulting in the correct
count.

I also adjusted how the =jt.classreader.Classfile=
constructor writes trace entries about its constant pool.  This way,
the text of the pool gets generated only if there is a log object to
print it.  I'm expecting a 25% improvement in performance as this
involves quite a bit of conversions when printing the entries in the
constant pool.

I also fixed a bug in =OOMetrics= so that it now uses the
=-project-name= command line switch instead of
=-project= to determine the project's name in reports.
