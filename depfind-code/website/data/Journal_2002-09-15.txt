Turns out =ListDiff= is not as easy to fix
as I first expected.  I know I have to be smarter than
just doing a prefix check in =ListDiffPrinter=,
but how do I distinguish between a package name, a class
name, and a field name?  The answer will drive how far the
prefix match has to go.

I have an idea.  I will have =ListDocumentedElements=
mark each entry with a suffix in "= [P]=",
"= [M]=", or "= [F]=".  Then, in
=ListBasedValidator=, I will trim it off.  That
will take care of =JarJarDiff= and the XSL
transformations.  Then, in =ListDiffPrinter=,
I can use this information to do better compression of the
lists.

I've opened a bug on the matter on the SourceForge
project page.
