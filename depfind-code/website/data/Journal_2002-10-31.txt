Got some new ideas on fixing the serialization of dependency
graphs.  I can separate the nodes from the dependencies and put
everything in a =Graph=-like object.  Each dependency
would become its own object, allowing me to record additional
information about each dependency such as its type (dependency,
association, generalization, realization) and weight (how many
times it occurs in the code).

Looked at possible graphical renders for metrics.
