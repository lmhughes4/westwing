Looked at a subset of metrics to compare how many =final= elements are in a
given codebase.  I will need to list elements (fields, methods, etc.) in order
to make sense of it all.  Right now, =MetricsGatherer= simply keeps counters
for all of these measurements and simply increments them by 1 as it traverses
the code.  I will need to change =MetricsGatherer= to send the name along to
the measurements so I can start using =NameListMeasurement= to get a list of
element names.
