Started working on a new printer for transitive closures.  This will
be harder than I thought.
=com.jeantessier.dependency.Printer= has way too much
machinery geared solely at printing graphs to be useful.  I also need
to figure out a way to find the closure's starting point _after_
the engine has computed it and possibly after the graph has been
reduced possibly as far as package-to-package.
