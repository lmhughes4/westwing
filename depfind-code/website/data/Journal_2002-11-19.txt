Technical documentation.

Discovered another free tool that deals with metrics:
[[http://www.kclee.com/clemens/java/javancss/][JavaNCSS]].
It includes two measurements: McCabe's cyclomatic complexity
and its own non-comment source statement.  I really need to move
=com.jeantessier.metrics= off of the Visitor pattern
and let people code and add their own measurements.

I looked up McCabe's cyclomatic complexity and it shouldn't
be too hard to implement.  It's basically just a matter of counting
specific instructions.

Found another, older article by
[[http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf][Robert C. Martin]]
about his "distance from the main sequence" dependency metric.
