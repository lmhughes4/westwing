For a while, I had thought about modifying =OOMetrics= to
output multiple formats in one call.  You could call it with
=-csv=, =-txt=, and =-xml= to generate
all three formats at the same time.  And I could do the same thing with
other tools than generate multiple output formats.  I finally decided
against.  There is very little value in this feature and it would need
broad sweeping changes in the way tools interpret command-line
arguments, such as figuring out the extension for the output filename.
I'll just leave things as they are for now.
