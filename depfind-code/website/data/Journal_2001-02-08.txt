I should consider turning this into an Ant task.

What if I used a =ClassLoader= instead to
trap class requests as the target class is being
resolved?  The good thing about looking at the
=.class= file only is that I don't need to
have all the dependencies on the =CLASSPATH=
at the time.

I looked at the classes used by =javac=
and it appears to be a mess.  I'll stick with my things
for now.
