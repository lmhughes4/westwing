I'm making progress with the user manual.  I've expanded the
TWiki-like notation to include HTML and inlined images.  I put
the working draft on the project's web site.  It'll be part of
the distribution for the next release.

I got my first support call today.  Someone is having difficulties
with one of the XSL converters.  This is all =Xalan=
stuff, so I'm thinking it might be JVM memory.  I instructed
them to set =DEPENDENCYFINDER_OPTS= and call me
back.
