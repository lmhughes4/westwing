Fixed a problem with [[http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/][IntelliJ IDEA]].  I am
using version 8.0M1 on a MacBook Pro.  My laptop wouldn't wake up after going
to sleep yesterday, so I had to do a hard reboot.  After that, IntelliJ
wouldn't recompile my classes.  It kept clearing the =classes= directory and
then couldn't find classes to run the tests.  I completely erased
=~/Library/Caches/IntelliJIDEA80= and restarted IntelliJ and that seemed to do
the trick.

Added tests for =Custom_attribute=.

Added visitor hooks for =*Annotations_attribute= and
=AnnotationDefault_attribute=, but I did not get to their substructures, yet.
