I started to reorganize the package
=com.jeantessier.dependency= (on paper) to separate the
classes that deal exclusively with the graph from those that deal in
terms of dependencies (from those about transitive closures).  Maybe
it's not as bad as I think.

Started looking at how Java 5.0 stores some of its more exotic
constructs, like variable argument methods and generics.  I found some
links to the updated JVM specification.  I have some work ahead of me.
The good news is that its all new special attributes and new access
flags, so everything kinds works already.  It's just that they are not
really accounted for when extracting dependencies or computing
metrics.

Moved =Hex= from package
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder= to package
=com.jeantessier.text= so classes in other packages can use
it to dump binary data to log files, like =Custom_attribute=
when logging the content of unknown attributes.
