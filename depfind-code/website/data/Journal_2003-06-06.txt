This is my luck.  The day after the 1.0 Release I find a number of
oversights.

First, =OOMetrics= still tries to print its printer.
This made sense when the printers contained a =StringBuffer=
and returned the text as part of their =toString()=
method.  But now, they print directly to the output stream and don't
have a =toString()= method anymore.  The output now has
weird strings in odd places, which actually breaks the XML output.

Second, the version information in the JAR file's manifest is the
stripped version: "10" instead of "1.0".  I added additional properties
in =build.xml= to handle CVS vs. version labels.

Third, some classes call =flush()= on streams before
closing them, and others don't.  The documentation says this is
redundant, so I removed all of these calls.

Added "Powered by ..." statement to all the JSPs.  This also gave me
an occasion to do minor touch ups in the HTML.

I realized that I ran =OOMetrics= on non-debug code
yesterday when I gathered metrics for the 1.0 release.  This means that
SLOC metrics are way off.  I'll have to figure a way to recompile that
version and rerun =OOMetrics=.
