Looking at the release plan, I think I'm a little dispersed right
now.  I need to focus and get things rolling again.  The holiday break
really threw me off and left me with a couple of unfinished tasks.  I'm
going to complete the documentation and fix the dependency closure bugs
and ship the net release ASAP.
