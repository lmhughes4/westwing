Fixed some tests.  Some of the Fit tests needed better explanations.  There was
one broken test in =com.jeantessier.classreader.TestXMLPrinter=.  This last one
was checked in broken, after I made a last minute change to the XML format.  I
need to be better disciplined at running all the tests before I check in code.
