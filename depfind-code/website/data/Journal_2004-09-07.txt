Wrote a new tool to list all symbolic names in a codebase:
=SymbolList=.  It shows all class names, all methods' full

was compiled with =-g= and retained its local variables
table, the tool can list method parameters and local variables too.

Phase VI: find what previous phases might have missed.

Phase VII: fix what previous phases had missed.
