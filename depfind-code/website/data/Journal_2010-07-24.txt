At [[http://shopwell.com][ShopWell]], we do a lot of design using post-it
stickies on foam boards.  We have many, many very large foam boards, to the
order of 100"x60".  We can stand at the foam board and have a hallway chat about
things.  We can more stickies around and group them and shift things around.  We
can easily more boards from one room to the next as needed.

On Dependency Finder, I'm a little overwhelmed by all the tasks I've identified
and written up over time, in so many places: the Release Plan, Pivotal Tracker,
5"x7" cards, notes, etc.  So I figured that if I could get them all on one foam
board, where I could see them all and easily manipulate them, it might get me
going again.  I went out, bought myself a board (a more modest 36"x24"), some
stickies, and a bunch of sharpies, and I'll get started running my own board
for Dependency Finder.
