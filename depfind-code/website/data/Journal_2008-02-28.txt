Added a very early version of =DependencyGraphToGraphML.xsl=.  It turns out
producing XML from XSLT is a non-issue (as you'd expect).  Just use
=&lt;xsl:output method%3D"xml"/&gt;=, which is kinda the default if the top
result node is not some variation of =&lt;html&gt;=, according to the
[[http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt][XSLT spec]].

I cleaned up the XSL templates.  I removed explicit
=&lt;xsl:output method%3D"html"/&gt;= tags because these templates make it
obvious that they produce HTML.  I wanted to remove =&lt;xsl:strip-space&gt;=
too, but that caused memory problems for large documents, so I kept them in.  I
inlined unnecessary =&lt;xsl:variable&gt;= tags all over the place.

One issue I have with all of this is that I don't have any kind of automated
tests for these XSL templates.  I could run a transformation and use XPath to
verify its output, but that would be tedious and brittle and hard to maintain.
I could record _golden_ outputs and compare the output of transformations to
them, but that would also be brittle.  This latter solution would nearly be the
only way to test XSL transforms that produce text.
