Everybody at work is asking how to use Dependency
Finder.  I guess I need to work on usability and the
intuitiveness of the user interface.

Also, maybe the default settings should not try to
print the whole dependency graph.  The two instances my
colleague deployed have over 50,000 nodes and the JVM
runs out of memory trying to render them.  A think a
default of package-to-package dependencies might be
better.

Here, I need to choose between default settings that
make it non-threatening to newbies versus settings that
people use most of the time, so the tool is quick to use,
without having to flip the same switches all the time.
