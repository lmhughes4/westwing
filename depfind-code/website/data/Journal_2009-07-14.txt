I have been running an experiment to launch Dependency Finder as an instance of
Jetty with the web app UI.  But Jetty seems flaky.  It runs fine at first, but
after a while, it starts throwing messages that can cannot find classes that
are obviously in the JAR.  I don't get it.  I've reverted to using Tomcat for
now.  I removed all the applications in its =webapps= folder and deployed
Dependency Finder as =ROOT= so I don't need a path element to access it.
