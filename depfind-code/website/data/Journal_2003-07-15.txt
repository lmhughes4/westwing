Found some typos in the page on A vs. I graphs.

The GUI could really benefit from a "reload" button.  I keep
having to do "New" and then "Extract", but that resets the controls,
which can have complex regular expressions in them.  All this is too
tedious.

Again in the GUI, it would be nice to save the results from
dependency queries to an XML document for future reference.
