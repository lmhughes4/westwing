Had a bout with the flu.

Jeff Harman asked questions about dependency visitors and such,
which prompted me to document that control flow a little more.  I'll
add the new information to the fledgling developer guide when I get
a change and when I can find a decent (free) editor for UML diagrams.

Had some ideas about correlating project size and complexity
and estimating each via the current metrics.  I might be able to
do something about complexity with a combination of intra-class,
intra-package, and extra-package dependencies at both the class
and method levels.
