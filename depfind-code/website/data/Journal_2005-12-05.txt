Wrote Fit tests using =fit.DoFixture= so I don't need to
write custom fixture classes.  The book and the documentation are a
little sketchy and I need quite a few trial and errors to get it to do
what I want.  Or, at least, almost what I want.

Fit still behaves differently between my desktop and my laptop.  I
am still baffled.
