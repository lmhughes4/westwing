I started writing more tests to check that interactions with Xerces
are tested.  In the process, I cleaned up some of the tests for classes
that generate XML documents.

I found some mistakes in =classfile.dtd=: missing
elements, typos in element and attribute names, those sorts of things.
I fixed them.  I also changed the generated XML so it does not pretend
to be standalone anymore.  The DTDs are on the project's website, how
can these documents be standalone!

Now, I need to write some regression tests for Xalan too.
