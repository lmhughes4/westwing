Renamed some of the XSL stylesheets.  The names confused me and I
always get confused about which one does what.

I have been thinking about an installer that would generate all the
=.bat= files and adjust them for Windows 98 vs. Windows NT
and JDK 1.3 vs. JDK 1.4.  I cannot use Perl because the machine where
you want to install it might not have Perl installed.  I cannot write
the installer as a DOS script either because string substitution would
just be too hard, or the Windows 98 version is quite limiting.  But I
could make it as a simple Java program.  And this way, it could figure
out the JVM version by itself, and even the OS from system properties.
Unless I have an epiphany, I won't delay the 1.0 release for this;
it'll go in the next release.
