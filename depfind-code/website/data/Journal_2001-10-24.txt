I found a bug in =jt.dependency.CodeDependencyCollector=
where it does not process =catch= clauses to include
dependencies on caught exceptions.

In order to fix this bug, I revisited
=jt.classreader.VisitorBase= to build in default
behavior that explores all parts of the classfile structure.

I also modified =DependencyFinder= to include
command-line switches =-trace= and =-verbose=.
