Moved the version stuff to its own class, but since it reads
information from its JAR file's manifest, I cannot find a way to test
it properly.  The good news is that with its no-args constructor, I
can use it in JSPs with the &lt;jsp:useBean&gt; tag.  Next, I will
outfit the CLI tools with a =-version= switch.  And maybe
I can even get an "About" box for the GUI.

On the downside, I am not too sure where to put this new class.  It
is in the new package =com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder=,
soon to be joined by tools to group the cut and pasted code that ends
up duplicated between the CLI, the GUI, the JSPs, and the Ant tasks.
I might even go as far as creating custom tags for the JSPs, or at
least JavaBeans for the parameters to the query, closure, and
dependency metrics engines.

I created a feature request to address the start scripts for Unix
(#787904).  Since I don't have an environment setup to develop and
tests and package on Unix (yet), I am going to leave these scripts in a
patch for now. These scripts don't use the contribution from Jonathan
Doughty because I am not done studying it, yet.  More on this later.
