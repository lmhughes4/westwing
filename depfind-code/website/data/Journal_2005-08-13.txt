Thought about my current dilemma regarding what to display in
=JarJarDiff= reports between entire APIs, published ones
only, and selective display.  I thought I could do it with XSL
transformations, but those are becoming too complex.  Plus, there is an
issue with using function calls in predicates that I still haven't
resolved.  I'm starting to think I'd better generate different reports
from =JarJarDiff= and have a single stylesheet to render
them in HTML.  I might do the same for the stylesheets that narrow
down dependency graphs instead of using
=DependencyReporter=.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>JDK</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.5.0_01</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.5.0_04</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>IntelliJ IDEA</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>4.5</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>5.0</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
