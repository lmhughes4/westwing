It's one of those bugs.  The moment I put in logging statements, the
=ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= suddenly starts to work.  Well, now
the classfile loader is loading the correct files.

Used =ModifiedOnlyDispatcher= in
=DependencyFinder=.  But along with
=extract.jsp=, it does not yet adjust its dependency graph
correctly.  I need to make them keep the old graph, remove reloaded
classes, and somehow remove classes that have altogether disappeared.
More work ahead.
