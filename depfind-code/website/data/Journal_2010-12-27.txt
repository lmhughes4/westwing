A user reported a bug with =EnclosingMethod_attribute= when the enclosing method
is a constructor.  When producing XML output from =ClassReader=, they sometimes
get the string "&lt;init&gt;" in some of the text, which XML parsers think is a
start tag and that the overall XML document is not well-formed.  I suspect this
is because an anonymous inner class is declared inside a constructor, since the
bytecode calls all constructors "&lt;init&gt;".  I also suspect that anonymous
inner classes declared inside a static initializer might produce an
=EnclosingMethod= structure with a method name of "&lt;clinit&gt;".
