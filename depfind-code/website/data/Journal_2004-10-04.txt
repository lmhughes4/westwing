Finished =LoadListenerVisitorAdapter=.

I also noticed that I have quite a few tools that do similar things.
I need to align the naming of all these tools.
=ListDeprecatedElements= lists symbols from compiled code.
It focuses solely on elements marked as deprecated.  It uses a
=Printer= to print elements as it finds them.
=SymbolList= lists symbols from compiled code.  You can
choose between class names and feature names, but it offers no
filtering.  It uses a =Collector= to assemble the output and
prints it as a separate operation.  =ListDocumentedElements=
lists symbols from source code by filtering of special javadoc tags.
