Finished moving my office to the next room down the hall.  I do have
quite a few books!

Someone asked me how to tie additional information to
=com.jeantessier.dependency.Node= objects for their
application.  My answer to them is to use the =Node=
instances as keys in a =java.util.Map=.  It implements
=equals()= and =hashCode()= based on the name of
the node, so comparisons will match just fine.  This allows you to
associate any arbitrary data to nodes without introducing any
additional dependencies in the node classes.
