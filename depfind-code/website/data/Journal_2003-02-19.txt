Tools docs.

Added an HTML index page to the documentation directory.

Got rid of the =-trace= command-line switch.  If
you want that level of details, edit =log4j.properties=.

Reworked the =-verbose= command-line switch.  It
prints progress as files are read and data is created, kind of like
the status bar in the Swing applications.  The tools use the new
=VerboseListener= to trap events and print them to the
specified output stream or file.  This has helped simplify the
code around =main()= in the tool classes.

Considered optimizing event sources so they don't do anything
if there are no registered listeners.  With the new mechanism
for =-verbose=, there is always at least one listener,
this optimization is therefore useless, so I dropped it.  For it
to make sense, I would have had to complexify the life cycle of
=VerboseListener= too much.

Added [[http://www.intellij.com][IntelliJ IDEA]]
and [[http://www.xref-tech.com][Xrefactory]]
to the resources page.
