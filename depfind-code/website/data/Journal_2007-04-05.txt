Figured a way to set properties for Ant targets within IntelliJ.  On other
platforms I've used, Windows and Linux, IntelliJ IDEA gets the environment
variables, but not on Mac OS X for some reason.  On the Mac, I have to set them
explicitly in the project.

Also on Mac OS X, FitLibrary tests have trouble copying some of the images in
the =files= subfolder, which has a =.svn= subfolder with Subversion-related
files.  Some of these are read-only and subsequent runs of the test suite has
trouble overwriting them again and again.  I had to add a =&lt;chmod&gt;=
task in =build.test.xml= to circumvent this.

Finally, the Mac OS X has timestamps on files with a resolution to the second.
One test was waiting only 50msec and so was failing on this platform.  I've
raised the sleep time to a full second, but I'm a little concerned at making
the tests take even longer.

Released version 1.2.0.
