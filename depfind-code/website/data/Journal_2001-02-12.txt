Regarding the need for compiling in debug mode
(=-g= switch).  This is required in order to
capture dependencies created by the type of local variables
in methods.  The compiler verifies the legality of type
assignments and then discards the type information.  When
the compiler is called with =-g=, it keeps the
type information to create the =LocalVariableTable=
attribute of =Code= attributes.  If the
assignment is legal, then it meets all the dependency
requirements.  It either uses the same dependency, or creates
a new one which is more restrictive than the initial
dependency (i.e., it transitively includes the former).
Dependencies are not automatically considered transitive,
but in this case they are.  It is therefore acceptable
to ignore the dropped dependency.  If someone really
wants to see it, he or she simply has to compile the
code using =-g= and run the dependency
finder again.
