Updated the code coverage reports, both jcoverage and Clover.  The last time
went all the way back to [[2003-07-20]].  The number have improved a bit but
they are still rather laughable.  I added the procedure for generating them to
the Developer Guide.

Upgraded my testing environment from Clover 1.3_01 to 1.3.4.
