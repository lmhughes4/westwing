Made =jt.dependency.MetricsGatherer= inherit from
=SubGraphSelector= instead of =VisitorBase=
so that I could apply scoping to metrics queries.  I had to
retrofit =DependencyFinder= and =DependencyMetrics=
to pass in the scoping parameters.

I wrote =GraphCopier=.  I can now easily make copies
of graphs before maximizing them.

I have unit tests, using JUnit, for =GraphCopier=.
