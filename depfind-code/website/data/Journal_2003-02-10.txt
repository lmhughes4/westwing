Used =onMouseOver= and =onMouseOut=
JavaScript event handlers in the JSPs instead of =onFocus=
and =onBlur= respectively.  This way, the hints appear
in the status area as the mouse goes over each field and the
user does not have to click into them, or use =TAB=
to move between them and see the hints.

Fixed the tables in the JSP so they show up correctly in
either Mozilla or IE.  Lucky I recently learned about
=&lt;tbody&gt;= and =&lt;colgroup&gt;=
tags.

Someone locked the CVS repository for the project.  I tried
to contact them through SourceForge, but the email bounced.  I
opened a trouble ticket with SourceForge in the hope they can blast
the lock themselves.

Added tasks in =build.xml= to convert the text files
that make up the documentation to HTML.  I also added by conversion
perl script, =bin/txt2html.pl=.  It is finally under
source control.  I had to adjust the =dist= target so it
does not include it in the distribution.

I realized that someone made a feature request on the SourceForge
project page.  This is the first time in over a year that Dependency
Finder has been open to the public.  The request is for Ant task
equivalents to the CLI tools.  This should be easy enough.  All the
XSL transforms can already be done with Ant's =&lt;xslt&gt;=
core task.  For the other tools, you could use Ant's
=&lt;java&gt;= task and pass in the equivalent parameters.
But I think I will go one step further and actually create a new
package with classes that extend
=org.apache.tools.ant.Task=.  I will add sample usage in
the Manual.  Thanks to Andy Laun for a great proposal.
