I have an automated task that scrapes the SourceForge "Files" page
for Dependency Finder and saves the download tallies in a
=.csv= file.  I've been running it for over a year now.  I
have a nice graph in Excel showing trends and releases.  I was a little
apprehensive about my Windows 98 PC not crashing while I was away on
vacation, so I was relieved to find it still running upon my return.
But unfortunately, SourceForge changed the HTML for the page the day
after I left, with the result that I collected no data for the whole
time I was away.  And now, I must rewrite the HTML scraper to account
for the new HTML.
