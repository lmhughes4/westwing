Added a Fit test for =MartinConfig.xml=.

Replaced the names of basic measurements in =Metrics= with an =enum= called
=BasicMeasurements=.

Simplified the =Measurement= interface by using autoboxing for numerical values
instead of explicit =add(*)=
and =*Value()= methods.

Replaced dependencies on =Collections.EMPTY_*= to their corresponding
=Collections.empty*()= instead for stronger type checking.
