Played with better logging in the webapp.  Right now, the application does not
log anything.  I cannot get any usage statistics from Tomcat's logs, since they
are essentially empty.  In a JSP, I can use =applicationContext.log()=, but it
writes no information about the context of the call.  Each page would have to
identify itself in the message it's trying to log.  I tried to use Log4J
instead, but I'm struggling with how to specify a package that only gets the
JSPs and not all of Dependency Finder.
