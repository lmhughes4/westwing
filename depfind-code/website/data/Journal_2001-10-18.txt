I fixed a bug in =jt.metrics.MetricsGatherer=
that caused a =NullPointerException= when analyzing
=java.lang.Object=.  It also skewed Depth of Inheritance
metrics.

I also fixed a bug when processing static class initializers.
They were getting attached to a no name class in the default
package.  Parsing the name correctly fixed the problem.

I might have to have two sets of parsed classes, one for
analysis and the other for support classes.  This is in order
to correctly compute the Depth of Inheritance metric.

I need to modify =jt.metrics.ui.OOMetrics= so that
it parses all classes before starting the analysis.  Right now,
it parses and analyzes each parameter on the command-line
separately.
