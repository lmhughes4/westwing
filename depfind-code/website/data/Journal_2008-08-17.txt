Spiked to adjust =CodeDependencyCollector= to filter parents in the dependency
graph too.  If a parent does not match the filter criteria, it is not included
in the graph.  I'm not sure this is the right thing to do.  What triggered the
spike is that the tests around the filtering in =CodeDependencyCollector= were
broken when I started extracting inheritance information.  The dependency on
the parent gets filtered correctly, but there is still an empty node for the
parent.  I could leave it there to preserve the parent-child relationships or I
could leave it out because the filter expresses an intent to ignore it.
