Svetlin Stanchev asked me to include a property file for Ant tasks
directly into =DependencyFinder.jar=, and also asked for
more extended Ant documentation.  I have had a task on my desk to
provide more process-related documentation for the Ant tasks and
provide examples of how to use them together to provide added value.  I
guess it's time I get to it.

Jason Bell, in his JDJ editorial for October 2003, talks about
"dependency rot" and how tracking dependencies is critical.  I need
to make him aware of Dependency Finder!  :-)
