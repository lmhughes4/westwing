Thought up of a way to have =TransitiveClosure= work on
the raw graph and do the summarization separately.  This works fine for
CLI and Ant tasks, but is awkward for the GUI and web application where
the user cannot easily save intermediary results.  These last two will
need to include the summarization function internally and rework their
UI accordingly.
