Continued work on =DifferenceStrategy= to encapsulate the
behavior behind =Differences.isEmpty()=.  Got through the
tests for classes and interfaces.

It turns out that constants have their value embedded directly into
their field entry.  I adjusted the new difference engine to look at
those values too (the old one was ignoring them).
