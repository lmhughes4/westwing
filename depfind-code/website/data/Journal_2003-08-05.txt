Published patch for choosing between a =GraphCopier= and
a =GraphSummarizer= when running dependency queries.  This
new patch (#784040) replaces two previous ones (#776154 and #776161)
and also fixes a bug in =ClassReader= where it sent its
=Printer= to the output stream and generated erroneous XML
data.

Found that =StatisticalMeasurement.CollectData()= was
both =synchronized= *and* had a
=synchronized= block inside that synchronized on
=this=.  This being redundant, I removed the synchronization
in the method signature and kept the internal block.  This way, it runs
a tinny bit faster when the data set has not changed.
