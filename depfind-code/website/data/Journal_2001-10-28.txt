For a while now, I have been less than pleased at having to
operate on maximized graphs.  I revised =jt.dependency.GraphCopier=
to make =jt.dependency.GraphSummarizer=.  The latter
explores the graph more fully to compensate for the sparseness of the
graph.  This modification will shorten the time it takes to read the graph,
but queries will take longer to process.  Usage in the field will tell which
mode works best on real projects, whether it is _normal_, _minimized_,
or _maximized_.  I had to retrofit =DependencyReporter=,
=DependencyMetrics=, and =DependencyFinder= and give
them the appropriate switches.
