=DeprecationReporter= is working great to track usage of
deprecated APIs.  Now, I need to provide a summary with counts broken
down by package.  I should be able to do this using
=OOMetrics= with the right configuration.  I will need a new
type of measurement to take into account the lists of deprecated
elements.

Adjusted the stylesheet for the website and the documentation to
remove the underlining in hyperlinks.  I think it makes them a little
easier to read.  They're still blue, so they stand out, of course.
