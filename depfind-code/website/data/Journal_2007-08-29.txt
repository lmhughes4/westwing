Created some test data and a FIT test for tracking extra-package dependencies
using OOMetrics.  Right now, it can control access to methods, including
constructors, but it does not handle fields.  That would require a bigger
change in =OOMetrics=.

I'm also considering adding a filtering function similar to the one in
=OOMetricsGUI=.  If I can find a way to extract symbols at a given access
level, I could then use them to filter the metrics report.
