Changed the default self-disposition of
=StatisticalMeasurement= to average values.  It
turns out that in my attempt yesterday, I had changed the
wrong default value in the measurement's initialization.

You can now expand =AccumulatorMeasurement=
values when using the =-expand= switch with the
=-txt= switch to =OOMetrics=.

Fixed =-verbose= and =-trace=
switches on all executables.

Fixed a bug in =SumMeasurement= when dealing
with =StatisticalMeasurement= and empty lines.

Allow group definitions to be defined by multiple
regular expressions.

Used =SumMeasurement= to compute SLOC on classes
as the sum of SLOC on submetrics + 1.  I still need to figure
out how to ignore counts for synthetic elements and add
abstract methods and =try {= lines.
