Fixed the =ListDocumentedElements= doclet so it
skips static initializers.

Added =dtd-prefix= switch to commands that
generate XML documents.  This allows users to point to local
DTDs when they are disconnected from the Internet.  The
user can simply use
"=-dtd-prefix %DEPENDENCYFINDER_HOME%\etc=".  The
default value points back to the Dependency Finder website.
