When extracting from ZIP or JAR files, the progress reports always
fall short of 100%.  I realized that this is because the size estimates
include directory entries and non-=.class= files.  The
progress function only counts =.class= files, and therefore
always comes up short a bit.  So I have added two new load-time events
for when the =ClassfileLoader= start on a file, regardless
of its extension, and when it is done with a file.  These events occur
before and after the =BeginClassfile= and
=EndClassfile= respectively.
