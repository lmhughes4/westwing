The good folks at Xalan fixed
[[http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13106][bug 13106]].
They pointed out that I violate an XSLT rule when I reference
validator instances in =match= clauses of
=&lt;xsl:template&gt;= tags.  It has been working
until now because Xalan is lenient, but there is no guarantee
that it will do so in the future or that the stylesheet will
work with another XSLT translator.  I will need to rewrite
the stylesheet to use =&lt;xsl:if&gt;= tags to do
the validation.

Wrote two outlines for articles or white papers on
Dependency Finder and JarJarDiff, respectively.
