Rewrote the web application so that the copyright notice at the
bottom is actually coming from =footer.jsp=, which gets
included using =&lt;jsp:include&gt;=.

For the longest time, I have tried to keep the JSPs as simple and
self-contained as possible.  I figured they would make handy examples
of how to use the various parts of Dependency Finder.  But now, they
are becoming more and more difficult to manage, with all that
duplicated HTML between them, and I am not even touching the duplicated
code between all versions of the tools.  Anyway, I decided to make my
life a little easier and at least break out the duplicated HTML to a
shared satellite JSP.
