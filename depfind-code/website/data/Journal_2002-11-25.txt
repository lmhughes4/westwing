Started working on a generator for a template for
documenting the tools that make up Dependency Finder.  I am
using a Perl script to scan the =bin/= directory
and automatically generate information about each script.
When I am done, the template will use the same kind of
annotation that I have been using for the user guide.
This way, I can use the same translator for both files to
convert them to HTML.  At first, I thought of generating
XML and then use XSLT to convert it to HTML, but managing
XML with embedded HTML tags proved too much.  This way,
the notation is simpler and the embedded HTML does not get
in the way.
