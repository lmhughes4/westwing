which deals with the signature for a class' static initializer.

I wrote a test (using JUnit 4) which exposed that =Feature_info.getName()= and
=Feature%5Finfo.getSignature()= were calling =UTF8%5Finfo.toString()= instead of
=UTF8_info.getValue()=, which tripped the mocks created by jMock.  It also
forced me to change the signature of the =Feature_info= constructor to depend
on =DataInput=, an interface, instead of =DataInputStream=, a concrete class.

Because the new test is a JUnit 4 test, I switched all =TestAll= suites to use
the JUnit 4 mechanism for constructing suites.  It lets me compose suites from
JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 suites and test, all mixed and matched.  I was bring back
=com.jeantessier.metrics.TestMetricsGatherer= into a single test target for all
tests.  The Fit tests are still in JUnit 3 suites.  I will need to take a good
look at them to upgrade them too, but I am too tired for this right now.
