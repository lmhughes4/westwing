Added usage hints to controls in web app JSPs.  I also
changed the look and feel and put it in an external CSS2
stylesheet.  It looks great in IE 5.0 but Netscape 4.7 has
trouble with the table that encloses controls.  The JSP
works, it just doesn't look as great.  I'll worry about it
later.

Added the same usage hints to controls as tool tips in
the Swing version of =Dependency Finder= and
=OOMetrics=.

Created a CSS stylesheet for this website.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Log4J</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.2.6</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2.7</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
