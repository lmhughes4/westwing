More work on
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D1800017&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][bug 1800017]].

In the process, I made the error reporting for bad regular expressions a little
more user-friendly.  I tried using a checked exception at first, but the change
quickly spread everywhere.  The exception class was in
=com.jeantessier.dependency= and as a result, every package suddenly depended
on it, including =com.jeantessier.classreader=, creating a circular dependency.
So I went back to an unchecked exception for the time being.
