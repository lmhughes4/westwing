Built a stop condition for the new closure engine and came up with
the public interface so I can control how many layers it computes.

Remove all remaining signs of support for object serialization.
This consisted namely of removing code that used
=java.io.ObjectInputStream= to read files and having
=com.jeantessier.dependency.Node= not implement
=java.io.Serializable= anymore.
