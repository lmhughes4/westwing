I'm still debating whether interactions between visitors should use double
dispatch or not.  Double dispatch is useful when you don't know the exact type
of the element being visited, so you cannot know which =visit()= method to use.
But when the decorating visitor is ready to dispatch to the decorated visitor,
it knows the concrete type of the visited element, so there is no need for
double dispatch.  I'm still tempted to keep using double dispatch nonetheless,
since it is the normal mechanism for passing control to a visitor and it makes
the interactions with the decorated visitor seem more natural.

I have produced an alternate sequence diagram that shows the flow of control
between three visitors composed visitor to render a dependency graph as text.

I also produced a matching version of the dependency graph for rendering a
dependency closure as a call graph.

I really like [[http://sdedit.sf.net/][sdedit]] for creating sequence diagrams.
