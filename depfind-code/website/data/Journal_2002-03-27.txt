I reorganized the =Differences= hierarchy to
make room for a Decorator pattern.  I'm reimplementing tracking
of deprecated features to arrange the code.  After that, I'll
be better able to take care of documented vs. undocumented
programming elements.

Right now, I've broken something.  I don't have the adequate
unit tests to tell me what it is that I broke.  I guess I've
been a bad boy.  This will take a little while to fix.
