Found a deficiency with
=com.jeantessier.classreader.XMLPrinter=: it
is not printing attributes of class fields.  I opened
a bug about it,
[[http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func%3Ddetail&aid%3D615616&group_id%3D43305&atid%3D435884][bug #615616]].

I used the Inherited Behavior design pattern to normalize
the handling of attributes across implementations of the
=com.jeantessier.classreader.Visitor= interface.
This solved the bug, but I had to change the DTD for
classfiles.  I don't know how that will impact validity
of outputs once I change it the web site that the tools
point to by default.

I worked out the problem with
=PublishedDiffToHTML.xsl=.  If I use the full
notation for Xalan extensions instead of the abbreviated
one for Java, it works just fine, even with Xalan 2.4.0.
So I will upgrade back to Xalan 2.4.0.  I opened a bug
with the Xalan folks:
[[http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=13106][Xalan bug 13106]].
