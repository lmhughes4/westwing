Changed =AttributeFactory= to use a Java enum instead of string constants when
deciding which =Attribute_info= subclass to instantiate.  Right now, the enum
is a public standalone enum and =AttributeFactory= is only one static method.
I'm thinking of combining them somehow, maybe make the enum a private enum of
=AttributeFactory=.
