Added a maximum cycle length to =CycleDetector=.

Healed tests for
=com.jeantessier.dependency.TestHTMLPrinter=.  It had been
a while since all the tests ran green.

In Java 5.0, some code compiles to strange forms.  Enums have an
implicit =values()= method that attempts to copy the
internal array of the enum's values.  It does this copying by calling
the array's =clone()= method, but the array is typed with
the enum's type, so it looks like a call to
=MyEnum[].clone()= and I can't seem to decide what kind of
dependency that is.  I need to investigate further.
