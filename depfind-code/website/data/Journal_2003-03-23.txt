Wrote Ant task for =DependencyExtractor=.  It turns out
that using a path-like structure is actually easier than extending
=MatchingTask=.  I hesitate about the name of the
attribute for the output file.  The other tools use =out=
but Ant recommends =destfile= instead.  So do I make it
consistent with other Dependency Finder tools or with other Ant
tasks?
