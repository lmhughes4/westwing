Found a problem when analyzing individual =.class= files.
For some reason, the GUI keeps on skipping them.  It turns out the
dispatcher gets called twice: once when initiating the group processing
and a second time to deal with the file as part of the group.  The
GUI uses a =ModifiedOnlyDispatcher=, which instructs the
=ClassfileLoader= to ignore the file after the first time,
so the file is never read.  The intricate collaboration between the
various =ClassfileLoader= subclasses will make this hard to
figure out.
