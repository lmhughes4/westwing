I fixed my HTML scraper to account for the new HTML on
SourceForge's download page.  It now seems to work just fine.  But the
data on SourceForge is stale.  The statistics page only go to
December 30, 2003.  I fear that SourceForge is having problems with its
statistics collection again.

Apparently, there were over 50 downloads of release 20020127 during
the holidays.  I don't see why people would be interested in that old
version.  Something is definitely fishy with SourceForge's statistics
and download tallies.
