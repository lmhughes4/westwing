Addressed a possible performance issue which
=com.jeantessier.metrics.XMLPrinter= where using
four spaces for indent was yielding _huge_ XML reports.
I changed =OOMetrics= to use a tab character
instead.  We'll see how it goes.  At the same time, I adjusted
=XMLPrinter= to generate &lt;measurement&gt;
nodes instead of &lt;metric&gt;.  It will also ignore
=NullMeasurement= instances from here on.

Use the system property =line.separator=
instead of "\n" in metrics reports.  This should help with
cross-platform portability.

Rigged =MetricsFactory= to handle group
definitions properly.

I've been looking at using tool tips in the header of the
result tables in =OOMetricsGUI= to expand the
measurement names.  Each header has an associated
=JComponent=, but getting to is proving rather
difficult.  I'd almost have to provide a custom
implementation of =TableColumnModel=, but I
only need to override a tiny piece of the behavior.  More
on this later.
