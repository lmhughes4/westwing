Expanded the documentation for dealing with Ant and XSL transforms.
Check out the documentation, under the "[[tasks/][Ant Tasks]]"
heading.

As I was preparing a reply to the original call for help, I noticed
that whether or not Log4J is configured properly can have a huge impact
on the performance of the tasks.  In one test, running
=DependencyExtractor= on Dependency Finder itself took over
7 minutes with the missing Log4J configuration versus 14 *seconds*
with the configuration that ships with Dependency Finder.  So if you
find that Dependency Finder is a little unresponsive, you might want
to check your Log4J configuration.
