Fixed JarJarDiff so the =-level= switch that takes a possible class name can
look for a constructor that takes a =DifferenceStrategy= before it falls back
on the default constructor.  This way, users can specify strategies that extend
=DifferenceStrategyDecorator= and have them decorate the same basic strategy
that =APIDifferenceStrategy= and =IncompatibleDifferenceStrategy= do.

I want to do the same thing for printers, too.
