Looked at [[http://addthis.com/][AddThis]] as a possible mechanism for coworkers
to share interesting Dependency Finder results on the webapp.  The default
AddThis email button puts the URL in the email message.  The URL is enough to
recreate the query and see the results.  I need to explore further if I can add
the query's results to the message.
