I don't know what SourceForge changed in their system, but their
advice for my CVS problems were to get the latest version of my client.
I did, and now everything's fine.  I find it very hard to believe that
they would change something as important as their CVS support without
telling anyone.  But what can you do.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>SmartCVS</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>2.4.2</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>3 rc</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I was finally able to check in my most recent changes, including
documentation of new switches on Ant tasks and use of long names for
measurements when writing to =.csv= files.

Finally got around to updating my copyright notices to 2004.

I want to do a beta release for the next release, tentatively 1.1,
compiled only for JDK 1.4.2 and above.  This will allow me to see if
anyone cares for me to stick with lower versions of the JDK.  If
enough people complain, I'll do the real release with JDK 1.3 again.
Or, they could simply get the source code and compile it themselves
with JDK 1.3 and track Xalan on their own, but I would have to stick
with Log4J and Jakarta-ORO for this to work.
