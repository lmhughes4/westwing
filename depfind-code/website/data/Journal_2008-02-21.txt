Fixed =MartinConfig.xml= to remove extraneous value selectors.  Both =Ca= and
=CaComp= aggregated class names from =IEPM= with these regular expressions:

    IEPM /^(.%2A)\.[^\.]%2A\(.%2A\)$/
    IEPM /^(.%2A)\.[\^.]%2A$/

The first one matches the class name portion of method names thanks to the
parentheses at the end.  The second regular expression (forget the typo for a
moment) does not include the parenthesized argument type list, so it can only
match field names.  But =IEPM= can only contain method names, never field names,
so this second regular expression is totally superfluous.  So I removed it.

With just the first regular expression, =Ca= and =CaComp= end up collapsing
=IEPM= to a list of distinct class names, which is what they need.
