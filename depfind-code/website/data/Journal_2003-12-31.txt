I'm away on vacation, but I still found the time to check in on
messages.  Someone has been having difficulties but I think it's just a
corrupted =.class= file.

They also asked to track database calls.  I hope they meant calls on
the JDBC API.  It is *very* difficult to track the actual SQL from
within Java.  You need to setup dynamic proxies to trap all calls to
statement objects and resolve parameters and all other kinds of
transformations.  This is way beyond the capabilities of Dependency
Finder, and well nigh impossible with static analysis alone.
