I got a fix for spaces in =DEPENDENCYFINDER_HOME=.  I have not tested it fully
yet, so I need a little more time before I give it my seal of approval.

Someone mentioned they are running out of memory when extracting dependencies
from large JAR files.  This is because the various printers use internal
=StringBuffer= instances that grow as the graph gets rendered.  I need to take
one more look at using character streams instead, like I mentioned on
[[2003-03-12]].

I went ahead and modified =com.jeantessier.classreader.Printer=,
=com.jeantessier.dependency.Printer=, and =com.jeantessier.metrics.Printer= to
take a =java.io.PrintWriter= instead of their =java.lang.StringBuffer=.  The
modifications were quite extensive, and =com.jeantessier.diff.Printer= is still
untouched.  It will need more rewriting than I am willing to deal with at this
time.
