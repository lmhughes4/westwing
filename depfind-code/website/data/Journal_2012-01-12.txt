Fixed calls to =&lt;javac&gt;= in the various =build.xml= files to include the
=includeantruntime= attribute needed by Ant 1.8.

This is stupid.  For the sake of preserving some old =build.xml= files, they
polluted all future =build.xml= files.  They could have made it a command-line
switch on Ant itself so old projects could fix it without corrupting all of our
projects.
