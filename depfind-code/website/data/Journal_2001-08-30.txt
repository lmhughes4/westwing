I fixed a bug in =jt.dependency.CodeDependencyCollector=.
It was not looking at the signature of called methods when looking
for dependencies.  I also stopped processing instruction =0xBB (new)=,
since the call to the constructor always follows shortly after.

I fixed a bug in =jt.dependency.PrettyPrinter=.  It was
not collecting dependencies correctly when they were between
different kinds of nodes (e.g., feature to class).

There was a bug with =jt.dependency.LinkMinimizer=.
It misses some redundancies.  The whole class had to be redone.
I now have a strong test suite for it and for
=jt.dependency.LinkMaximizer= too.
