Toying with the idea of changing the naming convention to adopt the
regular Java convention instead of my beloved C++ convention.  This
would mean renaming accessors to =getX()= and
=setX()= and renaming all methods and fields so they
start with a lowercase letter and use camel case.  That's a lot of
work and will obviously break the code of anyone who's be programming
to the API.  Is it acceptable, if it brings the code in line with what
people expect of Java code?  And it's quite an undertaking: 239 classes
and over 3,000 methods.
