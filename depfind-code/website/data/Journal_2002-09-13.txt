Someone found a problem with =ListDiff= and
how it compresses lists.  It turns out that my simple use
of prefixes when performing compression was a little too
simplistic after all.  Packages mask subpackages.  Classes
and fields with names that are prefix of others mask those
others.  This should be easy enough to fix.
