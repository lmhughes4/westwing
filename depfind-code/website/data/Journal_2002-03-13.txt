I have regained control over =DiffToExternalHTML=.

With finer control over validation, how the validation list
is generated and used becomes more and more important.  If we use
javadoc comments, and we want to track when things transition
from valid to invalid or vice versa, we now need a list for the
old version and a list for the new version.  How these two lists
are combined and used remains to be determined.  Should they be
fed to =JarJarDiff= and merged into the XML output?
Should they be fed to the XSL stylesheet, making it even more
convoluted?  And what about =DiffToHTML.xsl=?  Should
it start to use Java code too?

I streamlined =Diff.dtd= to remove duplicated
information in the output of =JarJarDiff=.
