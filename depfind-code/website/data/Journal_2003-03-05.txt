Fixed =TableHeaderListener= so the tooltips in table
header display correctly.  It wouldn't change the tooltip when you
moved the cursor between columns within the header.  I had to put
the tooltip login in =mouseMoved()= instead.  My current
use of this treats the whole header as one large component.

Then further tweaked the text of the tooltips, adding the range
information even to column headers and enhancing the tooltips'
descriptive quality.

Refactored the text rendering of =StatisticalMeasurement=
and centralized it.  This may change some more since I am not too
fond of mixing application logic and presentation logic, but I don't
have a better place at this time.

Fixed the named scope of two measurements in the default metrics
configuration.  There were mistakenly labeled _per group_ when they
are in fact _per class_.
