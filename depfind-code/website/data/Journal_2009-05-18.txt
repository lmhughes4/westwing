Someone found a typo in the documentation: =-csv= was written =-c_vs_=.  It's
all fixed, now.

I fixed =com.jeantessier.metrics.MetricsGatherer= to use
=Classfile.isSynthetic()= to determine if a class is synthetic or not.  It used
to look onl for the presence of a =Synthetic_attribute=, but in Java 1.5 the
synthetic property can be set in the =ACCESS_LEVEL= field of the =.class= file.
I will need to fix it for methods and fields too.

The deprecation level is computed the same way, by looking for the
=Deprecated_attribute=.  But in Java 1.5, it can also be set via an annotation.
This will require more work.
