I finally managed to create the CVS repository on
SourceForge.  I've uploaded a first version of the code,
but it still has the LGPL license instead of the BSD-style
one.

I also uploaded the release file in SourceForge's FRS.
One more thing to learn (and is not trivial).

I looked at [[http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/][BCEL]].
It looks too complex for me to bother with right now.
I already have something that works.  I'm going to stick with
it for now.  I like how my code uses the =Visitor=
pattern to provide hooks for traversing the structure.
