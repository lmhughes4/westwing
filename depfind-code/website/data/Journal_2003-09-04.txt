Semantic Designs, Inc. has a suite of tools to analyze source code,
compute metrics, and perform refactorings.

Infotectonica has a tool called Juliet that tracks dependencies and
cross-references with a lot of details and a rich query language.  It
works off of source code and integrates with popular IDEs.

Robert C. Martin came out with a book on software that is gathering
a lot of praise.  I have taken many ideas from his various papers and
presentations.  All that material is collected and augmented in
"Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns, and Practices".  I
just got my copy and I have been going through it slowly.  So far. so
good.  It holds up to expectations.
