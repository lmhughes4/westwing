Cleaned up =MartinConfig.xml= to compute Robert C.
Martin's =D'= metric.  I also drew a diagram of the various
measurements and how they feed into each other.  This might be useful
documentation.

CVS on SourceForge is still down.  This is annoying.  I don't want
to have too much code not checked in; it's not safe.
