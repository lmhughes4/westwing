Refactored =JarJarDiff= and the
=jt.dependencyfinder.diff= package.  I adjusted the
XSL stylesheet accordingly.  Now, all I need to do is be more
strict on what features are reported, and restrict the report
to a subset of packages.

Also, do we want feature signatures or full declarations in
lists?
