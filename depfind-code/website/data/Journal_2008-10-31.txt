More support for annotations.

Removed the back-reference from =Annotation= back to its containing
=RuntimeAnnotations_attribute= because it did not make sense in the case of an
annotation as an element value.

Rigged =ElementValueFactory= the same way I did for =AttributeFactory=.

I realized that most attributes hold on to a reference to the =Classfile= only
so that they can get the =ConstantPool= from it.  So I changed the code to
inject the =ConstantPool= directly instead of the =Classfile=.  This
refactoring touched 84 files.
