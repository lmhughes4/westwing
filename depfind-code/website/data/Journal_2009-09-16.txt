Going through the [[http://groovy.codehaus.org/][Groovy]] tutorial.  It is a
nice scripting language, a cool extension of Java.  You can name closure
parameters, just like Ruby, but it also has a default =it= if the closure needs
only one parameter.  I was able to compile to bytecode, using =groovyc=, and run
Dependency Finder on it.  But the code it generates is very hard to read, so
don't try it.  Generated code is meant to stay hidden.

Speaking of generated code, I saw a presentation on
[[http://ixedit.com][IxEdit]], a tool to generate JavaScript to tie controls on
a page.  While it is very slick for generating interactions, it generates code
that you then cut and paste into the HTML page.  I'm pretty sure this is *not*
maintainable.  The generated JavaScript is fairly opaque.  The demo didn't cover
how or if you could re-insert the code in the editor to refine interactions.
