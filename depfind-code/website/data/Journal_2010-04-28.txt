[[http://grails.org/][Grails]] already includes JAR files for
[[http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/index.html][Log4J]] 1.2.15 and
[[http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/][Jakarta ORO]] 2.0.8, the same versions that
Dependency Finder uses.  As an experiment, I created an empty Grails project and
copied only =DependencyFinder.jar= to its =lib/= directory.  I then started
=grails shell= and I was able to run the same operations as
=DependencyExtractor= by hand.  No big surprise there, but it was cool.

I want to redo the webapp as a Grails application.  I'm struggling with file
system issues, though.  Should I create a directory under the current tree where
I would put the new app, next to =web/= and =webwork/=?  That would be
consistent, but the new app would get a name from that directory, which would
most likely be called =grails=.  An alternative is to start a brand new tree
somewhere else, completely dissociated from the current Dependency Finder
development tree.  There, the application can be called =DependencyFinder= or
some such.  But I would have to start a new Git repository for it.  In either
case, I'll have to be creative to manage =DependencyFinder.jar= as it evolves.
