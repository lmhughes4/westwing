It turns out the problem with XSL was my fault.  Apparently,
I was not supposed to use the string "--" in comments the way
I did to format the copyright notice.  I'll put the fix in the
next release.  In the mean time, people can either edit the files
themselves or stick to the GUI.

I'm working on fixing =-verbose= and =-trace=
switches.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Log4J</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.1.3</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2alpha6</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

I thought about upgrading Jakarta ORO, who just came out with
version 2.0.5.  But the changes are just bug fixes that don't
impact me, so I decided against.

I'll also try to fix the dependency metrics for the next release.
