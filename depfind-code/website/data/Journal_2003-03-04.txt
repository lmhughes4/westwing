Added tooltips to =OOMetricsGUI=.  Column headers show
the measurement's full name, cells show the element's name,
measurement's full name, abbreviation, and value.

Removed the documentation of metrics and measurements.  With the
new tooltips, it is not all that necessary anymore.

I thought of putting a target in =build.xml= to
update the codebase from CVS, but I had trouble getting it to work
on Win98 and to authenticate properly, so I just dropped it.

Only the Ant tasks left.  I've had some ideas about extracting
the cut & pasted code in the tools and put it in central tool classes.
The Ant tasks would just be another way to invoke those tool classes.
So far, they would be in a new
=com.jeantessier.dependencyfinder= package.
