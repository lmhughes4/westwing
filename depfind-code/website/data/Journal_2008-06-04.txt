Tried to compile and run the tests with JDK 1.6.  Some of the tests fail
because of the new attribute =StackMapTable=, but other tests in
=com.jeantessier.diff= were also failing.  It turns out that
=APIDifferenceStrategy= uses =HashMap= internally to accumulate symbols when
looking for differences.  The iteration order is different between JDK 1.5 and
JDK 1.6, which results in the strategy using different code paths to decide
that two classes are different.  This throws off =MockDifferenceStrategy= and
therefore breaks the test.  =APIDifferenceStrategy= could use a =TreeMap=
instead, which would guarantee the iteration order.  While I'm at it, I should
probably re-write those tests to use jMock instead of a hand-rolled mock and
data read from disk.
