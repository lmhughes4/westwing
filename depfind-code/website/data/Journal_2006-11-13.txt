Simplified the command-line switch processing for =DependencyFinder=,
=DependencyCycles=, and =DependencyMetrics=.  I need to build aliasing support
in =com.jeantessier.commandline= instead of handling aliases in each CLI tool's
=main()= method.

I also adjusted the output form =DependencyMetrics= so it does not show NaN or
infinity when ratios involve a zero.

I am seeing again the case where the report from =DependencyMetrics= shows
strange numbers.  The number under "outbound link(s)" is the sum of the
breakdown under "inbound link(s)" and vice versa.  I remember looking into this
a while back and somehow convincing myself that this was right, but I am still
confused, which probably means I need to fix these sections so they are more
intuitive.

I also removed the =-all= switch from the CLI =OOMetrics=.
