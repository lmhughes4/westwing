Wrote a whole new tool to monitor usage of deprecated APIs.
=ListDeprecatedElements= scans JARs and collects a list of
names for deprecated classes, interfaces, fields, methods, and
constructors.  =DeprecationReporter= is a variation on
=DependencyReporter= that uses the list instead of
regular expressions to figure out the scope and does no filtering.
There are CLI and Ant versions of each, with associated
documentation.

Refactored =TestRecord= to use =StringReader=
to read back generated XML documents in strings.

Refactored =TestRegularExpressionSelectionCriteria= to
make all its fields private.
