I modified the =com.jeantessier.classreader= package
so that =ClassfileLoader= can notify listeners as soon
as a =.class= file is loaded.  This way, tools like
=DependencyExtractor= can use a
=TransientClassfileLoader= since it does not need the
=Classfile= instance once the dependencies have been
extracted.
