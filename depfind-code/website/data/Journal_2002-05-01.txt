Fixed bugs in:

    * =com.jeantessier.classreader.DirectoryClassfileReader=
    * =com.jeantessier.classreader.JarClassfileReader=
    * =com.jeantessier.classreader.ZipClassfileReader=

where they were not closing the files they were opening.
This resulted in locked resources under Windows NT that
prevented me from recompiling classes after finding out stuff
about them.

Upgraded the following development components:

<blockquote>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Log4J</td>
        <td>:</td>
        <td>1.2beta3</td>
        <td>-></td>
        <td>1.2rc1</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
