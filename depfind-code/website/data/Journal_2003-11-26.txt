Sent a message on Ant's user mailing list to request that they add
Dependency Finder to Ant's list of external tools.  I'll have to keep
an eye on their file to see how long it takes them to include the
reference.

Did some code clean up to replace error reporting via system
=println()= calls with logging via Log4J instead.

I want to revamp the release schedule.  I'm going to break it up
into smaller chunks so I can have smaller, more frequent releases.  I
am going to put most of the small, miscellaneous tasks as
"unscheduled", that is I will not hold up a release just because of
them, but I will work on them as time allows.
