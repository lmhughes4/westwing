Finally got around to cleaning up some of the HTML on the website.
The documents say they use HTML 4.01, but I try to follow XHTML as much
as possible.  This sometimes yields strange results on some browsers.
For instance, I like to have empty named anchors as
=&lt;a name="someName" /&gt;= but some browsers won't see
the empty tag but a start tag instead and proceed to underline all text
after it.  So I have to write it as
=&lt;a name="someName"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;=.  But that doesn't
work for =&lt;br&gt;= or =&lt;hr&gt;= because
they do not allow any content and therefore the notations
=&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;= and
=&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/hr&gt;= are illegal.  For those, I can still
write =&lt;br /&gt;= or =&lt;hr /&gt;= because
the browser doesn't expect any content and simply ignores the trailing
=/=.  So my rule has been to write closing tags for elements
that can have content, and the XML empty notation when the elements
cannot have content.  That should fix it for most people.
