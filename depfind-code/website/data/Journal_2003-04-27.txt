I have been trying to add Dependency Finder tasks to the build
file, but Ant's &lt;xslt&gt; tasks has problems with some of the XSL
transformations.  At least =DependenciesToHTML= generates
and error about "not enough DTMs", whatever that means.  I can still
run the transform with the CLI script, so I will have to investigate
some more.

I just need to add a legend to the diagrams for
=JarJarDiff= and write up the project's policy regarding
code contributions.  Then I can release the beta.
