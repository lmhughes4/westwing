I have fixed all the unit tests except the one for
=StatisticalMeasurement=.  I've got it pretty much
figured out, but there is just a lot of code to change to fix
these.

I stumbled by pure chance on articles by Martin Fowler on
coupling and public vs. published interfaces.  I am now
thinking of writing follow up articles that show how
Dependency Finder helps with addressing these issues.
