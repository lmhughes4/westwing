Renamed =SignatureHelper= to =DescriptorHelper=.  I used the word _signature_
in its non-java sense of a method's identifier and argument types and order.
But Java 1.5 has a specific structure in the =.class= file named _signature_ to
represent information about type parameters of generics.  Since my previous
=SignatureHelper= was manipulating _descriptor_ constructs, I renamed it
=DescriptorHelper= to prevent confusion.  I will introduce a new
=SignatureHelper= later to deal with the new _signature_ constructs.

I took this opportunity to move some of the functionality that only dealt with
class names to the new helper =ClassNameHelper=.  I suspect that
=SignatureHelper= will need it too, so it makes sense to have it in some shared
location instead of tying =DescriptorHelper= and =SignatureHelper= together
somehow.
